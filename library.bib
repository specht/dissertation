abstract = {Automated methods for assigning peptides to observed tandem mass spectra typically return a list of peptide−spectrum matches, ranked according to an arbitrary score. In this article, we describe methods for converting these arbitrary scores into more useful statistical significance measures. These methods employ a decoy sequence database as a model of the null hypothesis, and use false discovery rate (FDR) analysis to correct for multiple testing. We first describe a simple FDR inference method and then describe how estimating and taking into account the percentage of incorrectly identified spectra in the entire data set can lead to increased statistical power.},

abstract = {Protein phosphorylation is a key regulatory event in most cellular processes and development. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics provides a framework for the large-scale identification and characterization of phosphorylation sites. Here, we used a well-established phosphopeptide enrichment and identification strategy including the combination of strong cation exchange chromatography, immobilized metal affinity chromatography, and high-accuracy mass spectrometry instrumentation to study phosphorylation in developing Drosophila embryos. In total, 13 720 different phosphorylation sites were discovered from 2702 proteins with an estimated false-discovery rate (FDR) of 0.63\% at the peptide level. Because of the large size of the data set, both novel and known phosphorylation motifs were extracted using the Motif-X algorithm, including those representative of potential ordered phosphorylation events.},

abstract = {We present a new approach that allows the identification of intron-split peptides from mass spectrometric data in genomic databases. Our algorithm uses small regions of peptide sequence information which are automatically deduced from de novo amino acid sequence predictions together with the molecular mass information of the precursor ion. The sequence predictions are based on selected collision-induced mass spectrometric fragmentation spectra. Fragments of the predicted amino acid sequence are aligned with each of the six frames of the translated genome and the precursor mass information is used to assemble the corresponding tryptic peptides using the sequence as a matrix. Hereby, intron-split peptides can be gathered and in turn verified by mass spectrometric data interpretation tools such as Sequest.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:The amount of information stemming from proteomics experiments involving (multi dimensional) separation techniques, mass spectrometric analysis, and computational analysis is ever-increasing. Data from such an experimental workflow needs to be captured, related and analyzed. Biological experiments within this scope produce heterogenic data ranging from pictures of one or two-dimensional protein maps and spectra recorded by tandem mass spectrometry to text-based identifications made by algorithms which analyze these spectra. Additionally, peptide and corresponding protein information needs to be displayed.RESULTS:In order to handle the large amount of data from computational processing of mass spectrometric experiments, automatic import scripts are available and the necessity for manual input to the database has been minimized. Information is in a generic format which abstracts from specific software tools typically used in such an experimental workflow. The software is therefore capable of storing and cross analysing results from many algorithms. A novel feature and a focus of this database is to facilitate protein identification by using peptides identified from mass spectrometry and link this information directly to respective protein maps. Additionally, our application employs spectral counting for quantitative presentation of the data. All information can be linked to hot spots on images to place the results into an experimental context. A summary of identified proteins, containing all relevant information per hot spot, is automatically generated, usually upon either a change in the underlying protein models or due to newly imported identifications. The supporting information for this report can be accessed in multiple ways using the user interface provided by the application.CONCLUSION:We present a proteomics database which aims to greatly reduce evaluation time of results from mass spectrometric experiments and enhance result quality by allowing consistent data handling. Import functionality, automatic protein detection, and summary creation act together to facilitate data analysis. In addition, supporting information for these findings is readily accessible via the graphical user interface provided. The database schema and the implementation, which can easily be installed on virtually any server, can be downloaded in the form of a compressed file from our project webpage.},

abstract = {Stable isotope labeling combined with MS is a powerful method for measuring relative protein abundances, for instance, by differential metabolic labeling of some or all amino acids with (14)N and (15)N in cell culture or hydroponic media. These and most other types of quantitative proteomics experiments using high-throughput technologies, such as LC-MS/MS, generate large amounts of raw MS data. This data needs to be processed efficiently and automatically, from the mass spectrometer to statistically evaluated protein identifications and abundance ratios. This paper describes in detail an approach to the automated analysis of uniformly (14)N/(15)N-labeled proteins using MASCOT peptide identification in conjunction with the trans-proteomic pipeline (TPP) and a few scripts to integrate the analysis workflow. Two large proteomic datasets from uniformly labeled Arabidopsis thaliana were used to illustrate the analysis pipeline. The pipeline can be fully automated and uses only common or freely available software.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Experimental techniques in proteomics have seen rapid development over the last few years. Volume and complexity of the data have both been growing at a similar rate. Accordingly, data management and analysis are one of the major challenges in proteomics. Flexible algorithms are required to handle changing experimental setups and to assist in developing and validating new methods. In order to facilitate these studies, it would be desirable to have a flexible 'toolbox' of versatile and user-friendly applications allowing for rapid construction of computational workflows in proteomics. RESULTS: We describe a set of tools for proteomics data analysis-TOPP, The OpenMS Proteomics Pipeline. TOPP provides a set of computational tools which can be easily combined into analysis pipelines even by non-experts and can be used in proteomics workflows. These applications range from useful utilities (file format conversion, peak picking) over wrapper applications for known applications (e.g. Mascot) to completely new algorithmic techniques for data reduction and data analysis. We anticipate that TOPP will greatly facilitate rapid prototyping of proteomics data evaluation pipelines. As such, we describe the basic concepts and the current abilities of TOPP and illustrate these concepts in the context of two example applications: the identification of peptides from a raw dataset through database search and the complex analysis of a standard addition experiment for the absolute quantitation of biomarkers. The latter example demonstrates TOPP's ability to construct flexible analysis pipelines in support of complex experimental setups. AVAILABILITY: The TOPP components are available as open-source software under the lesser GNU public license (LGPL). Source code is available from the project website at www.OpenMS.de},

abstract = {MS/MS and associated database search algorithms are essential proteomic tools for identifying peptides. Due to their widespread use, it is now time to perform a systematic analysis of the various algorithms currently in use. Using blood specimens used in the HUPO Plasma Proteome Project, we have evaluated five search algorithms with respect to their sensitivity and specificity, and have also accurately benchmarked them based on specified false-positive (FP) rates. Spectrum Mill and SEQUEST performed well in terms of sensitivity, but were inferior to MASCOT, X!Tandem, and Sonar in terms of specificity. Overall, MASCOT, a probabilistic search algorithm, correctly identified most peptides based on a specified FP rate. The rescoring algorithm, PeptideProphet, enhanced the overall performance of the SEQUEST algorithm, as well as provided predictable FP error rates. Ideally, score thresholds should be calculated for each peptide spectrum or minimally, derived from a reversed-sequence search as demonstrated in this study based on a validated data set. The availability of open-source search algorithms, such as X!Tandem, makes it feasible to further improve the validation process (manual or automatic) on the basis of "consensus scoring", i.e., the use of multiple (at least two) search algorithms to reduce the number of FPs. complement.},

abstract = {Gene annotation underpins genome science. Most often protein coding sequence is inferred from the genome based on transcript evidence and computational predictions. While generally correct, gene models suffer from errors in reading frame, exon border definition, and exon identification. To ascertain the error rate of Arabidopsis thaliana gene models, we isolated proteins from a sample of Arabidopsis tissues and determined the amino acid sequences of 144,079 distinct peptides by tandem mass spectrometry. The peptides corresponded to 1 or more of 3 different translations of the genome: a 6-frame translation, an exon splice-graph, and the currently annotated proteome. The majority of the peptides (126,055) resided in existing gene models (12,769 confirmed proteins), comprising 40\% of annotated genes. Surprisingly, 18,024 novel peptides were found that do not correspond to annotated genes. Using the gene finding program AUGUSTUS and 5,426 novel peptides that occurred in clusters, we discovered 778 new protein-coding genes and refined the annotation of an additional 695 gene models. The remaining 13,449 novel peptides provide high quality annotation (>99\% correct) for thousands of additional genes. Our observation that 18,024 of 144,079 peptides did not match current gene models suggests that 13\% of the Arabidopsis proteome was incomplete due to approximately equal numbers of missing and incorrect gene models.},

abstract = {Liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) has become the preferred method for conducting large-scale surveys of proteomes. Automated interpretation of tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) spectra can be problematic, however, for a variety of reasons. As most sequence search engines return results even for ‘unmatchable’ spectra, proteome researchers must devise ways to distinguish correct from incorrect peptide identifications. The target-decoy search strategy represents a straightforward and effective way to manage this effort. Despite the apparent simplicity of this method, some controversy surrounds its successful application. Here we clarify our preferred methodology by addressing four issues based on observed decoy hit frequencies: (i) the major assumptions made with this database search strategy are reasonable; (ii) concatenated target- decoy database searches are preferable to separate target and decoy database searches; (iii) the theoretical error associated with target-decoy false positive (FP) rate measurements can be estimated; and (iv) alternate methods for constructing decoy databases are similarly effective once certain considerations are taken into account.},

We propose a surface-based glyph placement strategy reducing visual clutter as well as image-space glyph aggregation. Thus the user is not distracted by unwanted clustering, and his focus of attention can rather be guided using appropriate visual appearances. Furthermore, we present techniques to make the setup of glyph-based visualizations more intuitive. These concepts have been integrated into a user interface which supports easy configuration and comparison of different glyph setups.

abstract = {Annotation of protein-coding genes is a key goal of genome sequencing projects. In spite of tremendous recent advances in computational gene finding, comprehensive annotation remains a challenge. Peptide mass spectrometry is a powerful tool for researching the dynamic proteome and suggests an attractive approach to discover and validate protein-coding genes. We present algorithms to construct and efficiently search spectra against a genomic database, with no prior knowledge of encoded proteins. By searching a corpus of 18.5 million tandem mass spectra (MS/MS) from human proteomic samples, we validate 39,000 exons and 11,000 introns at the level of translation. We present translation-level evidence for novel or extended exons in 16 genes, confirm translation of 224 hypothetical proteins, and discover or confirm over 40 alternative splicing events. Polymorphisms are efficiently encoded in our database, allowing us to observe variant alleles for 308 coding SNPs. Finally, we demonstrate the use of mass spectrometry to improve automated gene prediction, adding 800 correct exons to our predictions using a simple rescoring strategy. Our results demonstrate that proteomic profiling should play a role in any genome sequencing project.},

abstract = {We describe an algorithm for the automated statistical analysis of protein abundance ratios (ASAPRatio) of proteins contained in two samples. Proteins are labeled with distinct stable-isotope tags and fragmented, and the tagged peptide fragments are separated by liquid chromatography (LC) and analyzed by electrospray ionization (ESI) tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). The algorithm utilizes the signals recorded for the different isotopic forms of peptides of identical sequence and numerical and statistical methods, such as Savitzky-Golay smoothing filters, statistics for weighted samples, and Dixon's test for outliers, to evaluate protein abundance ratios and their associated errors. The algorithm also provides a statistical assessment to distinguish proteins of significant abundance changes from a population of proteins of unchanged abundance. To evaluate its performance, two sets of LC-ESI-MS/MS data were analyzed by the ASAPRatio algorithm without human intervention, and the data were related to the expected and manually validated values. The utility of the ASAPRatio program was clearly demonstrated by its speed and the accuracy of the generated protein abundance ratios and by its capability to identify specific core components of the RNA polymerase II transcription complex within a high background of copurifying proteins.},

abstract = {Recent proliferation of low-cost DNA sequencing techniques will soon lead to an explosive growth in the number of sequenced genomes and will turn manual annotations into a luxury. Mass spectrometry recently emerged as a valuable technique for proteogenomic annotations that improves on the state-of-the-art in predicting genes and other features. However, previous proteogenomic approaches were limited to a single genome and did not take advantage of analyzing mass spectrometry data from multiple genomes at once. We show that such a comparative proteogenomics approach (like comparative genomics) allows one to address the problems that remained beyond the reach of the traditional "single proteome" approach in mass spectrometry. In particular, we show how comparative proteogenomics addresses the notoriously difficult problem of "one-hit-wonders" in proteomics, improves on the existing gene prediction tools in genomics, and allows identification of rare post-translational modifications. We therefore argue that complementing DNA sequencing projects by comparative proteogenomics projects can be a viable approach to improve both genomic and proteomic annotations.},

abstract = {The identification and characterization of peptides from tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) data represents a critical aspect of proteomics. Today, tandem MS analysis is often performed by only using a single identification program achieving identification rates between 10-50\% (Elias and Gygi, 2007). Beside the development of new analysis tools, recent publications describe also the pipelining of different search programs to increase the identification rate (Hartler et al., 2007; Keller et al., 2005). The Swiss Protein Identification Toolbox (swissPIT) follows this approach, but goes a step further by providing the user an expandable multi-tool platform capable of executing workflows to analyze tandem MS-based data. One of the major problems in proteomics is the absent of standardized workflows to analyze the produced data. This includes the pre-processing part as well as the final identification of peptides and proteins. The main idea of swissPIT is not only the usage of different identification tool in parallel, but also the meaningful concatenation of different identification strategies at the same time. The swissPIT is open source software but we also provide a user-friendly web platform, which demonstrates the capabilities of our software and which is available at http://swisspit.cscs.ch upon request for account.},
