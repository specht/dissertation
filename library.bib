abstract = {Recent successes illustrate the role of mass spectrometry-based proteomics as an indispensable tool for molecular and cellular biology and for the emerging field of systems biology. These include the study of protein-protein interactions via affinity-based isolations on a small and proteome-wide scale, the mapping of numerous organelles, the concurrent description of the malaria parasite genome and proteome, and the generation of quantitative protein profiles from diverse species. The ability of mass spectrometry to identify and, increasingly, to precisely quantify thousands of proteins from complex samples can be expected to impact broadly on biology and medicine.},

@article{Bern2007,
abstract = {A powerful technique for peptide and protein identification is tandem mass spectrometry followed by database search using a program such as SEQUEST or Mascot. These programs, however, become slow and lose sensitivity when allowing nonspecific cleavages or peptide modifications. De novo sequencing and hybrid methods such as sequence tagging offer speed and robustness for wider searches, yet these approaches require better spectra with more complete and consecutive fragmentation and, hence, are less sensitive to low-abundance peptides. Here we describe a new hybrid method that retains the sensitivity of pure database search. The method uses a small amount of de novo analysis to identify likely b- and y-ion peaks--"lookup peaks"--that can then be used to extract candidate peptides from the database, with the number of candidates tunable to fit a computing budget. We describe a program called ByOnic that implements this method, and we benchmark ByOnic on several data sets, including one of mouse blood plasma spiked with low concentrations of recombinant human proteins. We demonstrate that ByOnic is more sensitive than sequence tagging and, indeed, more sensitive than the three most popular pure database search tools--SEQUEST, Mascot, and X!Tandem--on both the peptide and protein levels. On the mouse plasma samples, ByOnic consistently found spiked proteins missed by the other tools.},

abstract = {In this paper we present concepts for integrating glyphs into volumetric data sets. These concepts have been developed with the goal to make glyphbased visualization of multimodal volumetric data sets more flexible and intuitive. We propose a surface-based glyph placement strategy reducing visual clutter as well as image-space glyph aggregation. Thus the user is not distracted by unwanted clustering, and his focus of attention can rather be guided using appropriate visual appearances. Furthermore, we present techniques to make the setup of glyph-based visualizations more intuitive. These concepts have been integrated into a user interface which supports easy configuration and comparison of different glyph setups. Based on the chosen setup a visual legend is generated automatically to make a step towards quantitative visual analysis. We will discuss the placement strategy as well as the glyph setup process, explain the used rendering techniques and provide application examples of multimodal visualizations using the proposed concepts. 1},

I start with the best-characterized systems from the Drosophila sex determination pathway, and then describe the regulators of other systems about whose mechanisms there is some data. How these regulators are combined into complex systems of tissue-specific splicing is discussed. In conclusion, very recent studies are presented that point to new directions for understanding alternative splicing and its mechanisms.},

In this article, we describe methods for converting these arbitrary scores into more useful statistical significance measures.

We first describe a simple FDR inference method and then describe how estimating and taking into account the percentage of incorrectly identified spectra in the entire data set can lead to increased statistical power.},

abstract = {The identification and characterization of peptides from MS/MS data represents a critical aspect of proteomics. It has been the subject of extensive research in bioinformatics resulting in the generation of a fair number of identification software tools. Most often, only one program with a specific and unvarying set of parameters is selected for identifying proteins. Hence, a significant proportion of the experimental spectra do not match the peptide sequences in the screened database due to inappropriate parameters or scoring schemes. The Swiss protein identification toolbox (swissPIT) project provides the scientific community with an expandable multitool platform for automated in-depth analysis of MS data also able to handle data from high-throughput experiments. With swissPIT many problems have been solved: The missing standards for input and output formats (A), creation of analysis workflows (B), unified result visualization (C), and simplicity of the user interface (D). Currently, swissPIT supports four different programs implementing two different search strategies to identify MS/MS spectra. Conceived to handle the calculation-intensive needs of each of the programs, swissPIT uses the distributed resources of a Swiss-wide computer Grid (http://www.swing-grid.ch).},

abstract = {Mass spectrometry-based proteomics critically depends on algorithms for data interpretation. A current bottleneck in the rapid advance of proteomics technology is the closed nature and slow development cycle of vendor-supplied software solutions. We have created an open source software environment, called MSQuant, which allows visualization and validation of peptide identification results directly on the raw mass spectrometric data. MSQuant iteratively recalibrates MS data thereby significantly increasing mass accuracy leading to fewer false positive peptide identifications. Algorithms to increase data quality include an MS3 score for peptide identification and a post-translational modification (PTM) score that determines the probability that a modification such as phosphorylation is placed at a specific residue in an identified peptide. MSQuant supports relative protein quantitation based on precursor ion intensities, including element labels (e.g., 15N), residue labels (e.g., SILAC and ICAT), termini labels (e.g., 18O), functional group labels (e.g., mTRAQ), and label-free ion intensity approaches. MSQuant is available, including an installer and supporting scripts, at http://msquant.sourceforge.net .},

abstract = {Peptide identification of tandem mass spectra by a variety of available search algorithms forms the foundation for much of modern day mass spectrometry-based proteomics. Despite the critical importance of proper evaluation and interpretation of the results generated by these algorithms there is still little consistency in their application or understanding of their similarities and differences. A survey was conducted of four tandem mass spectrometry peptide identification search algorithms, including Mascot, Open Mass Spectrometry Search Algorithm, Sequest, and X! Tandem. The same input data, search parameters, and sequence library were used for the searches. Comparisons were based on commonly used scoring methodologies for each algorithm and on the results of a target-decoy approach to sequence library searching. The results indicated that there is little difference in the output of the algorithms so long as consistent scoring procedures are applied. The results showed that some commonly used scoring procedures may lead to excessive false discovery rates. Finally an alternative method for the determination of an optimal cutoff threshold is proposed.},

@article{Mantini2007,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mass spectrometry protein profiling is a promising tool for biomarker discovery in clinical proteomics. However, the development of a reliable approach for the separation of protein signals from noise is required. In this paper, LIMPIC, a computational method for the detection of protein peaks from linear-mode MALDI-TOF data is proposed. LIMPIC is based on novel techniques for background noise reduction and baseline removal. Peak detection is performed considering the presence of a non-homogeneous noise level in the mass spectrum. A comparison of the peaks collected from multiple spectra is used to classify them on the basis of a detection rate parameter, and hence to separate the protein signals from other disturbances. RESULTS: LIMPIC preprocessing proves to be superior than other classical preprocessing techniques, allowing for a reliable decomposition of the background noise and the baseline drift from the MALDI-TOF mass spectra. It provides lower coefficient of variation associated with the peak intensity, improving the reliability of the information that can be extracted from single spectra. Our results show that LIMPIC peak-picking is effective even in low protein concentration regimes. The analytical comparison with commercial and freeware peak-picking algorithms demonstrates its superior performances in terms of sensitivity and specificity, both on in-vitro purified protein samples and human plasma samples. CONCLUSION: The quantitative information on the peak intensity extracted with LIMPIC could be used for the recognition of significant protein profiles by means of advanced statistic tools: LIMPIC might be valuable in the perspective of biomarker discovery.},

In this communication, we describe a new de novo sequencing software package, PEAKS, to extract amino acid sequence information without the use of databases. PEAKS uses a new model and a new algorithm to efficiently compute the best peptide sequences whose fragment ions can best interpret the peaks in the MS/MS spectrum. The output of the software gives amino acid sequences with confidence scores for the entire sequences, as well as an additional novel positional scoring scheme for portions of the sequences. The performance of PEAKS is compared with Lutefisk, a well-known de novo sequencing software, using quadrupole-time-of-flight (Q-TOF) data obtained for several tryptic peptides from standard proteins.},

abstract = {The identification and characterization of peptides from tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) data represents a critical aspect of proteomics. Today, tandem MS analysis is often performed by only using a single identification program achieving identification rates between 10-50\% (Elias and Gygi, 2007). Beside the development of new analysis tools, recent publications describe also the pipelining of different search programs to increase the identification rate (Hartler et al., 2007; Keller et al., 2005). The Swiss Protein Identification Toolbox (swissPIT) follows this approach, but goes a step further by providing the user an expandable multi-tool platform capable of executing workflows to analyze tandem MS-based data. One of the major problems in proteomics is the absent of standardized workflows to analyze the produced data. This includes the pre-processing part as well as the final identification of peptides and proteins. The main idea of swissPIT is not only the usage of different identification tool in parallel, but also the meaningful concatenation of different identification strategies at the same time. The swissPIT is open source software but we also provide a user-friendly web platform, which demonstrates the capabilities of our software and which is available at http://swisspit.cscs.ch upon request for account.},

abstract = {The yeast phosphatidylinositol-transfer protein (Sec14) catalyses exchange of phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylcholine between membrane bilayers in vitro. In vivo, Sec14 activity is essential for vesicle budding from the Golgi complex. Here we report a three-dimensional structure for Sec14 at 2.5 A resolution. Sec14 consists of twelve alpha-helices, six beta-strands, eight 3(10)-helices and has two distinct domains. The carboxy-terminal domain forms a hydrophobic pocket which, in the crystal structure, is occupied by two molecules of n-octyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside and represents the phospholipid-binding domain. This pocket is reinforced by a string motif whose disruption in a sec14 temperature-sensitive mutant results in destabilization of the phospholipid-binding domain. Finally, we have identified an unusual surface helix that may play a critical role in driving Sec14-mediated phospholipid exchange. From this structure, we derive the first molecular clues into how a phosphatidylinositol-transfer protein functions.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Mass spectrometry (MS) combined with high-performance liquid chromatography (LC) has received considerable attention for high-throughput analysis of proteomes. Isotopic labeling techniques such as ICAT [5,6] have been successfully applied to derive differential quantitative information for two protein samples, however at the price of significantly increased complexity of the experimental setup. To overcome these limitations, we consider a label-free setting where correspondences between elements of two samples have to be established prior to the comparative analysis. The alignment between samples is achieved by nonlinear robust ridge regression. The correspondence estimates are guided in a semi-supervised fashion by prior information which is derived from sequenced tandem mass spectra. RESULTS: The semi-supervised method for finding correspondences was successfully applied to aligning highly complex protein samples, even if they exhibit large variations due to different biological conditions. A large-scale experiment clearly demonstrates that the proposed method bridges the gap between statistical data analysis and label-free quantitative differential proteomics.

abstract = {Proteomics is a rapidly emerging set of key technologies that are being used to identify proteins and map their interactions in a cellular context. With the sequencing of the human genome, the scope of proteomics has shifted from protein identification and characterization to include protein structure, function and protein-protein interactions. Technologies used in proteomic research include two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, mass spectrometry, yeast two-hybrids screens, and computational prediction programs. While some of these technologies have been in use for a long time, they are currently being applied to study physiology and cellular processes in high-throughput formats. It is the high-throughput approach that defines and characterizes modern proteomics. In this review, we discuss the current status of these experimental and computational technologies relevant to the three major aspects of proteomics-characterization of proteomes, identification of proteins, and determination of protein function. We also briefly discuss the development of new proteomic technologies that are based on recent advances in analytical and biochemical techniques, engineering, microfabrication, and computational prowess. The integration of these advances with established technologies is invaluable for the drive toward a comprehensive understanding of protein structure and function in the cellular milieu.},

abstract = {Although the Human Genome Project was completed 4 years ago, the catalog of human protein-coding genes remains a matter of controversy. Current catalogs list a total of approximately 24,500 putative protein-coding genes. It is broadly suspected that a large fraction of these entries are functionally meaningless ORFs present by chance in RNA transcripts, because they show no evidence of evolutionary conservation with mouse or dog. However, there is currently no scientific justification for excluding ORFs simply because they fail to show evolutionary conservation: the alternative hypothesis is that most of these ORFs are actually valid human genes that reflect gene innovation in the primate lineage or gene loss in the other lineages. Here, we reject this hypothesis by carefully analyzing the nonconserved ORFs-specifically, their properties in other primates. We show that the vast majority of these ORFs are random occurrences. The analysis yields, as a by-product, a major revision of the current human catalogs, cutting the number of protein-coding genes to approximately 20,500. Specifically, it suggests that nonconserved ORFs should be added to the human gene catalog only if there is clear evidence of an encoded protein. It also provides a principled methodology for evaluating future proposed additions to the human gene catalog. Finally, the results indicate that there has been relatively little true innovation in mammalian protein-coding genes.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Experimental techniques in proteomics have seen rapid development over the last few years. Volume and complexity of the data have both been growing at a similar rate. Accordingly, data management and analysis are one of the major challenges in proteomics. Flexible algorithms are required to handle changing experimental setups and to assist in developing and validating new methods. In order to facilitate these studies, it would be desirable to have a flexible 'toolbox' of versatile and user-friendly applications allowing for rapid construction of computational workflows in proteomics. RESULTS: We describe a set of tools for proteomics data analysis-TOPP, The OpenMS Proteomics Pipeline. TOPP provides a set of computational tools which can be easily combined into analysis pipelines even by non-experts and can be used in proteomics workflows. These applications range from useful utilities (file format conversion, peak picking) over wrapper applications for known applications (e.g. Mascot) to completely new algorithmic techniques for data reduction and data analysis. We anticipate that TOPP will greatly facilitate rapid prototyping of proteomics data evaluation pipelines. As such, we describe the basic concepts and the current abilities of TOPP and illustrate these concepts in the context of two example applications: the identification of peptides from a raw dataset through database search and the complex analysis of a standard addition experiment for the absolute quantitation of biomarkers. The latter example demonstrates TOPP's ability to construct flexible analysis pipelines in support of complex experimental setups. AVAILABILITY: The TOPP components are available as open-source software under the lesser GNU public license (LGPL). Source code is available from the project website at www.OpenMS.de},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:The amount of information stemming from proteomics experiments involving (multi dimensional) separation techniques, mass spectrometric analysis, and computational analysis is ever-increasing. Data from such an experimental workflow needs to be captured, related and analyzed. Biological experiments within this scope produce heterogenic data ranging from pictures of one or two-dimensional protein maps and spectra recorded by tandem mass spectrometry to text-based identifications made by algorithms which analyze these spectra. Additionally, peptide and corresponding protein information needs to be displayed.RESULTS:In order to handle the large amount of data from computational processing of mass spectrometric experiments, automatic import scripts are available and the necessity for manual input to the database has been minimized. Information is in a generic format which abstracts from specific software tools typically used in such an experimental workflow. The software is therefore capable of storing and cross analysing results from many algorithms. A novel feature and a focus of this database is to facilitate protein identification by using peptides identified from mass spectrometry and link this information directly to respective protein maps. Additionally, our application employs spectral counting for quantitative presentation of the data. All information can be linked to hot spots on images to place the results into an experimental context. A summary of identified proteins, containing all relevant information per hot spot, is automatically generated, usually upon either a change in the underlying protein models or due to newly imported identifications. The supporting information for this report can be accessed in multiple ways using the user interface provided by the application.CONCLUSION:We present a proteomics database which aims to greatly reduce evaluation time of results from mass spectrometric experiments and enhance result quality by allowing consistent data handling. Import functionality, automatic protein detection, and summary creation act together to facilitate data analysis. In addition, supporting information for these findings is readily accessible via the graphical user interface provided. The database schema and the implementation, which can easily be installed on virtually any server, can be downloaded in the form of a compressed file from our project webpage.},

abstract = {Gene annotation underpins genome science. Most often protein coding sequence is inferred from the genome based on transcript evidence and computational predictions. While generally correct, gene models suffer from errors in reading frame, exon border definition, and exon identification. To ascertain the error rate of Arabidopsis thaliana gene models, we isolated proteins from a sample of Arabidopsis tissues and determined the amino acid sequences of 144,079 distinct peptides by tandem mass spectrometry. The peptides corresponded to 1 or more of 3 different translations of the genome: a 6-frame translation, an exon splice-graph, and the currently annotated proteome. The majority of the peptides (126,055) resided in existing gene models (12,769 confirmed proteins), comprising 40\% of annotated genes. Surprisingly, 18,024 novel peptides were found that do not correspond to annotated genes. Using the gene finding program AUGUSTUS and 5,426 novel peptides that occurred in clusters, we discovered 778 new protein-coding genes and refined the annotation of an additional 695 gene models. The remaining 13,449 novel peptides provide high quality annotation (>99\% correct) for thousands of additional genes. Our observation that 18,024 of 144,079 peptides did not match current gene models suggests that 13\% of the Arabidopsis proteome was incomplete due to approximately equal numbers of missing and incorrect gene models.},

To identify proteins involved during anaerobic acclimation as well as to localize proteins and pathways to the powerhouses of the cell, chloroplasts and mitochondria from in aerobic and anaerobic (induced by 8 h of argon bubbling) conditions were isolated and analyzed using comparative proteomics. A total of 2315 proteins were identified. Further analysis based on spectral counting clearly localized 606 of these proteins to the chloroplast, including many proteins of the fermentative metabolism. Comparative quantitative analyses were performed with the chloroplast-localized proteins using stable isotopic labeling of amino acids ([C]arginine/[C]arginine in an arginine auxotrophic strain). The quantitative data confirmed proteins previously characterized as induced at the transcript level as well as identified several new proteins of unknown function induced under anaerobic conditions. These proteins of unknown function provide new candidates for further investigation, which could bring insights for the engineering of hydrogen-producing alga strains.},

Mass spectrometry recently emerged as a valuable technique for proteogenomic annotations that improves on the state-of-the-art in predicting genes and other features. However, previous proteogenomic approaches were limited to a single genome and did not take advantage of analyzing mass spectrometry data from multiple genomes at once. We show that such a comparative proteogenomics approach (like comparative genomics) allows one to address the problems that remained beyond the reach of the traditional "single proteome" approach in mass spectrometry. In particular, we show how comparative proteogenomics addresses the notoriously difficult problem of "one-hit-wonders" in proteomics, improves on the existing gene prediction tools in genomics, and allows identification of rare post-translational modifications. We therefore argue that complementing DNA sequencing projects by comparative proteogenomics projects can be a viable approach to improve both genomic and proteomic annotations.},

abstract = {Genetic, chemical, and environmental perturbations can all induce large changes in cellular proteomes, and research aimed at quantifying these changes are an important part of modern biology. Although improvements in the hardware and software of mass spectrometers have produced increased throughput and accuracy of such measurements, new uses of heavy isotope internal standards that assist in this process have emerged. Surprisingly, even complex life forms such as mammals can be grown to near-complete replacement with heavy isotopes of common biological elements such as (15)N, and these isotopically labeled organisms provide excellent controls for isolating and identifying experimental variables such as extraction or fractionation efficiencies. We discuss here the theory and practice of these technologies, as well as provide a review of significant recent biological applications.},

abstract = {During the last decade new ionization techniques have made it possible to measure the molecular weight of many intact proteins by mass spectrometry, and they have made it much easier to obtain a mass spectrometric peptide map of a protein. At the same time advances in protein and DNA sequencing technology are resulting in an exponential increase in the number of sequences deposited in databases. Here we investigate the possibility to use mass spectrometric data to identify proteins in databases. Searching a database by total molecular weight is found to be an easy and sometimes sufficient approach. For more specificity and for error tolerance in both the mass spectrometric data and the database information we search by partial mass spectrometric peptide map of the protein. In general, just four to six proteolytic peptides measured with a mass accuracy between 0.1 and 0.01\% allow a useful search of databases such as the Protein Identification Resource (PIR). As the size of DNA and protein sequence databases grows, protein identification by partial mass spectrometric peptide maps should become increasingly powerful and may become a general method to identify and characterize proteins.},

It consists of three steps: (1) preparation of microsomal fractions from cells or tissues representing different states; (2) covalent tagging of the proteins with isotope-coded affinity tag (ICAT) reagents followed by proteolysis of the combined labeled protein samples; and (3) isolation, identification, and quantification of the tagged peptides by multidimensional chromatography, automated tandem mass spectrometry, and computational analysis of the obtained data. The method was used to identify and determine the ratios of abundance of each of 491 proteins contained in the microsomal fractions of na\"{\i}ve and in vitro- differentiated human myeloid leukemia (HL-60) cells.

@article{Armengaud2010,
abstract = {This review describes how intimately proteogenomics and system biology are imbricated. Quantitative cell-wide monitoring of cellular processes and the analysis of this information is the basis for systems biology. Establishing the most comprehensive protein-parts list is an essential prerequisite prior to analysis of the cell-wide dynamics of proteins, their post-translational modifications, their complex network interactions and interpretation of these data as a whole. High-quality genome annotation is, thus, a crucial basis. Proteogenomics consists of high-throughput identification and characterization of proteins by extra-large shotgun MS/MS approaches and the integration of these data with genomic data. Discovery of the remaining unannotated genes, defining translational start sites, listing signal peptide processing events and post-translational modifications, are tasks that can currently be carried out at a full-genomic scale as soon as the genomic sequence is available. Proteomics is increasingly being used at the primary stage of genome annotation and such an approach may become standard in the near future for genome projects. Advantageously, the same experimental proteomic datasets may be used to characterize the specific metabolic traits of the organism under study. Undoubtedly, comparative genomics will experience a renaissance taking into account this new dimension. Synthetic biology aimed at re-engineering living systems will also benefit from these significant progresses.},

We investigated with this technique soluble proteins of mouse tissues (whole embryos, the liver of fetal and adult mice, kidneys) and the proteins of mouse serum. The technique was tested under a number of different conditions to find those best for our purpose; they may represent some general improvements in the method. The protein patterns show high resolution and excellent reproducibility. About 275 spots were found for fetal liver, about 230 for whole embryos (day 14 p.c.) and about 100 for serum. The fact that a high number of protein spots can be evaluated by a single and comparatively simple experiment suggests that this method may be useful as an assay system for induced point mutations. The protein patterns demonstrated are compared and discgs of dominant lethal examinations after acute and subacute application of these three substances.},

abstract = {Advances in Fourier transform mass spectrometry have made the acquisition of high-resolution and accurate mass measurements routine on a chromatographic time scale. Here we report an algorithm, Hardkl\"{o}r, for the rapid and robust analysis of high-resolution mass spectra acquired in shotgun proteomics experiments. Our algorithm is demonstrated in the analysis of an Escherichia coli enriched membrane fraction. The mass spectrometry data of the respective peptides are acquired by microcapillary HPLC on an LTQ-orbitrap mass spectrometer with data-dependent acquisition of MS/MS spectra. Hardkl\"{o}r detects 211,272 total peptide isotope distributions over a 2-h analysis (75-min gradient) in only a small fraction of the time required to acquire the data. From these data there are 13,665 distinct, chromatographically persistent peptide isotope distributions. Hardkl\"{o}r is also used to assess the quality of the product ion spectra and finds that more than 11.2\% of the MS/MS spectra are composed of fragment ions from multiple different molecular species. Additionally, a method is reported that enzymatically labels N-linked glycosylation sites on proteins, creating a unique isotope signature that can be detected with Hardkl\"{o}r. Using the protein invertase, Hardkl\"{o}r identifies 18O-labeled peptide isotope distributions of four glycosylation sites. The speed and robustness of the algorithm create a versatile tool that can be used in many different areas of mass spectrometry data analysis.},

A three-way genome comparison of the CFT073, enterohemorrhagic E. coli EDL933, and laboratory strain MG1655 reveals that, amazingly, only 39.2\% of their combined (nonredundant) set of proteins actually are common to all three strains. The pathogen genomes are as different from each other as each pathogen is from the benign strain. The difference in disease potential between O157:H7 and CFT073 is reflected in the absence of genes for type III secretion system or phage- and plasmid-encoded toxins found in some classes of diarrheagenic E. coli. The CFT073 genome is particularly rich in genes that encode potential fimbrial adhesins, autotransporters, iron-sequestration systems, and phase-switch recombinases. Striking differences exist between the large pathogenicity islands of CFT073 and two other well-studied uropathogenic E. coli strains, J96 and 536. Comparisons indicate that extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli arose independently from multiple clonal lineages. The different E. coli pathotypes have maintained a remarkable synteny of common, vertically evolved genes, whereas many islands interrupting this common backbone have been acquired by different horizontal transfer events in each strain.},

abstract = {Analyzing vertebrate genomes requires rapid mRNA/DNA and cross-species protein alignments. A new tool, BLAT, is more accurate and 500 times faster than popular existing tools for mRNA/DNA alignments and 50 times faster for protein alignments at sensitivity settings typically used when comparing vertebrate sequences. BLAT's speed stems from an index of all nonoverlapping K-mers in the genome. This index fits inside the RAM of inexpensive computers, and need only be computed once for each genome assembly. BLAT has several major stages. It uses the index to find regions in the genome likely to be homologous to the query sequence. It performs an alignment between homologous regions. It stitches together these aligned regions (often exons) into larger alignments (typically genes). Finally, BLAT revisits small internal exons possibly missed at the first stage and adjusts large gap boundaries that have canonical splice sites where feasible. This paper describes how BLAT was optimized. Effects on speed and sensitivity are explored for various K-mer sizes, mismatch schemes, and number of required index matches. BLAT is compared with other alignment programs on various test sets and then used in several genome-wide applications. http://genome.ucsc.edu hosts a web-basedBLAT server for the human genome.},

abstract = {Liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) has become the preferred method for conducting large-scale surveys of proteomes. Automated interpretation of tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) spectra can be problematic, however, for a variety of reasons. As most sequence search engines return results even for ‘unmatchable’ spectra, proteome researchers must devise ways to distinguish correct from incorrect peptide identifications. The target-decoy search strategy represents a straightforward and effective way to manage this effort. Despite the apparent simplicity of this method, some controversy surrounds its successful application. Here we clarify our preferred methodology by addressing four issues based on observed decoy hit frequencies: (i) the major assumptions made with this database search strategy are reasonable; (ii) concatenated target- decoy database searches are preferable to separate target and decoy database searches; (iii) the theoretical error associated with target-decoy false positive (FP) rate measurements can be estimated; and (iv) alternate methods for constructing decoy databases are similarly effective once certain considerations are taken into account.},

@article{Labadorf2010,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Genome-wide computational analysis of alternative splicing (AS) in several flowering plants has revealed that pre-mRNAs from about 30\% of genes undergo AS. Chlamydomonas, a simple unicellular green alga, is part of the lineage that includes land plants. However, it diverged from land plants about one billion years ago. Hence, it serves as a good model system to study alternative splicing in early photosynthetic eukaryotes, to obtain insights into the evolution of this process in plants, and to compare splicing in simple unicellular photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic eukaryotes. We performed a global analysis of alternative splicing in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii using its recently completed genome sequence and all available ESTs and cDNAs. RESULTS: Our analysis of AS using BLAT and a modified version of the Sircah tool revealed AS of 498 transcriptional units with 611 events, representing about 3\% of the total number of genes. As in land plants, intron retention is the most prevalent form of AS. Retained introns and skipped exons tend to be shorter than their counterparts in constitutively spliced genes. The splice site signals in all types of AS events are weaker than those in constitutively spliced genes. Furthermore, in alternatively spliced genes, the prevalent splice form has a stronger splice site signal than the non-prevalent form. Analysis of constitutively spliced introns revealed an over-abundance of motifs with simple repetitive elements in comparison to introns involved in intron retention. In almost all cases, AS results in a truncated ORF, leading to a coding sequence that is around 50\% shorter than the prevalent splice form. Using RT-PCR we verified AS of two genes and show that they produce more isoforms than indicated by EST data. All cDNA/EST alignments and splice graphs are provided in a website at http://combi.cs.colostate.edu/as/chlamy. CONCLUSIONS: The extent of AS in Chlamydomonas that we observed is much smaller than observed in land plants, but is much higher than in simple unicellular heterotrophic eukaryotes. The percentage of different alternative splicing events is similar to flowering plants. Prevalence of constitutive and alternative splicing in Chlamydomonas, together with its simplicity, many available public resources, and well developed genetic and molecular tools for this organism make it an excellent model system to elucidate the mechanisms involved in regulated splicing in photosynthetic eukaryotes.},

abstract = {A 2.91-billion base pair (bp) consensus sequence of the euchromatic portion of the human genome was generated by the whole-genome shotgun sequencing method. The 14.8-billion bp DNA sequence was generated over 9 months from 27,271,853 high-quality sequence reads (5.11-fold coverage of the genome) from both ends of plasmid clones made from the DNA of five individuals. Two assembly strategies-a whole-genome assembly and a regional chromosome assembly-were used, each combining sequence data from Celera and the publicly funded genome effort. The public data were shredded into 550-bp segments to create a 2.9-fold coverage of those genome regions that had been sequenced, without including biases inherent in the cloning and assembly procedure used by the publicly funded group. This brought the effective coverage in the assemblies to eightfold, reducing the number and size of gaps in the final assembly over what would be obtained with 5.11-fold coverage. The two assembly strategies yielded very similar results that largely agree with independent mapping data. The assemblies effectively cover the euchromatic regions of the human chromosomes. More than 90\% of the genome is in scaffold assemblies of 100,000 bp or more, and 25\% of the genome is in scaffolds of 10 million bp or larger. Analysis of the genome sequence revealed 26,588 protein-encoding transcripts for which there was strong corroborating evidence and an additional approximately 12,000 computationally derived genes with mouse matches or other weak supporting evidence. Although gene-dense clusters are obvious, almost half the genes are dispersed in low G+C sequence separated by large tracts of apparently noncoding sequence. Only 1.1\% of the genome is spanned by exons, whereas 24\% is in introns, with 75\% of the genome being intergenic DNA. Duplications of segmental blocks, ranging in size up to chromosomal lengths, are abundant throughout the genome and reveal a complex evolutionary history. Comparative genomic analysis indicates vertebrate expansions of genes associated with neuronal function, with tissue-specific developmental regulation, and with the hemostasis and immune systems. DNA sequence comparisons between the consensus sequence and publicly funded genome data provided locations of 2.1 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). A random pair of human haploid genomes differed at a rate of 1 bp per 1250 on average, but there was marked heterogeneity in the level of polymorphism across the genome. Less than 1\% of all SNPs resulted in variation in proteins, but the task of determining which SNPs have functional consequences remains an open challenge.},

abstract = {Mass spectrometry (MS) is the most comprehensive and versatile tool in large-scale proteomics. In this review, we dissect the overall framework of the MS experiment into its key components. We discuss the fundamentals of proteomic analyses as well as recent developments in the areas of separation methods, instrumentation, and overall experimental design. We highlight both the inherent strengths and limitations of protein MS and offer a rough guide for selecting an experimental design based on the goals of the analysis. We emphasize the versatility of the Orbitrap, a novel mass analyzer that features high resolution (up to 150,000), high mass accuracy (2-5 ppm), a mass-to-charge range of 6000, and a dynamic range greater than 10(3). High mass accuracy of the Orbitrap expands the arsenal of the data acquisition and analysis approaches compared with a low-resolution instrument. We discuss various chromatographic techniques, including multidimensional separation and ultra-performance liquid chromatography. Multidimensional protein identification technology (MudPIT) involves a continuum sample preparation, orthogonal separations, and MS and software solutions. We discuss several aspects of MudPIT applications to quantitative phosphoproteomics. MudPIT application to large-scale analysis of phosphoproteins includes (a) a fractionation procedure for motif-specific enrichment of phosphopeptides, (b) development of informatics tools for interrogation and validation of shotgun phosphopeptide data, and (c) in-depth data analysis for simultaneous determination of protein expression and phosphorylation levels, analog to western blot measurements. We illustrate MudPIT application to quantitative phosphoproteomics of the beta adrenergic pathway. We discuss several biological discoveries made via mass spectrometry pipelines with a focus on cell signaling proteomics.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: We present the results of EGASP, a community experiment to assess the state-of-the-art in genome annotation within the ENCODE regions, which span 1\% of the human genome sequence. The experiment had two major goals: the assessment of the accuracy of computational methods to predict protein coding genes; and the overall assessment of the completeness of the current human genome annotations as represented in the ENCODE regions. For the computational prediction assessment, eighteen groups contributed gene predictions. We evaluated these submissions against each other based on a 'reference set' of annotations generated as part of the GENCODE project. These annotations were not available to the prediction groups prior to the submission deadline, so that their predictions were blind and an external advisory committee could perform a fair assessment. RESULTS: The best methods had at least one gene transcript correctly predicted for close to 70\% of the annotated genes. Nevertheless, the multiple transcript accuracy, taking into account alternative splicing, reached only approximately 40\% to 50\% accuracy. At the coding nucleotide level, the best programs reached an accuracy of 90\% in both sensitivity and specificity. Programs relying on mRNA and protein sequences were the most accurate in reproducing the manually curated annotations. Experimental validation shows that only a very small percentage (3.2\%) of the selected 221 computationally predicted exons outside of the existing annotation could be verified. CONCLUSION: This is the first such experiment in human DNA, and we have followed the standards established in a similar experiment, GASP1, in Drosophila melanogaster. We believe the results presented here contribute to the value of ongoing large-scale annotation projects and should guide further experimental methods when being scaled up to the entire human genome sequence.},

By integrating multiple mass measurements and correcting for linear and nonlinear mass offsets, we achieve mass accuracy in the p.p.b. range, a sixfold increase over standard techniques. We increase the proportion of identified fragmentation spectra to 73\% for SILAC peptide pairs via unambiguous assignment of isotope and missed-cleavage state and individual mass precision. MaxQuant automatically quantifies several hundred thousand peptides per SILAC-proteome experiment and allows statistically robust identification and quantification of 44,000 proteins in mammalian cell lysates.},

We sequenced the approximately 120-megabase nuclear genome of Chlamydomonas and performed comparative phylogenomic analyses, identifying genes encoding uncharacterized proteins that are likely associated with the function and biogenesis of chloroplasts or eukaryotic flagella. Analyses of the Chlamydomonas genome advance our understanding of the ancestral eukaryotic cell, reveal previously unknown genes associated with photosynthetic and flagellar functions, and establish links between ciliopathy and the composition and function of flagella.},

While early work consisted merely of listing proteins identified in a given organ or under different conditions of interest, there is a growing need to apply comparative and quantitative proteomics strategies toward gaining novel insights into functional aspects of plant proteins and their dynamics. However, during the transition from qualitative to quantitative protein analysis, the potential and challenges will be tightly coupled. Several strategies for differential proteomics that involve stable isotopes or label-free comparisons and their statistical assessment are possible, each having specific strengths and limitations. Furthermore, incomplete proteome coverage and restricted dynamic range still impose the strongest limitations to data throughput and precise quantitative analysis. This review gives an overview of the current state of the art in differential proteomics and possible strategies in data processing.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Modern transcriptomics and proteomics enable us to survey the expression of RNAs and proteins at large scales. While these data are usually generated and analyzed separately, there is an increasing interest in comparing and co-analyzing transcriptome and proteome expression data. A major open question is whether transcriptome and proteome expression is linked and how it is coordinated. RESULTS: Here we have developed a probabilistic clustering model that permits analysis of the links between transcriptomic and proteomic profiles in a sensible and flexible manner. Our coupled mixture model defines a prior probability distribution over the component to which a protein profile should be assigned conditioned on which component the associated mRNA profile belongs to. We apply this approach to a large dataset of quantitative transcriptomic and proteomic expression data obtained from a human breast epithelial cell line (HMEC). The results reveal a complex relationship between transcriptome and proteome with most mRNA clusters linked to at least two protein clusters, and vice versa. A more detailed analysis incorporating information on gene function from the Gene Ontology database shows that a high correlation of mRNA and protein expression is limited to the components of some molecular machines, such as the ribosome, cell adhesion complexes and the TCP-1 chaperonin involved in protein folding.

@article{Pappin1993,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Developments in 'soft' ionisation techniques have revolutionized mass-spectro-metric approaches for the analysis of protein structure. For more than a decade, such techniques have been used, in conjuction with digestion b specific proteases, to produce accurate peptide molecular weight 'fingerprints' of proteins. These fingerprints have commonly been used to screen known proteins, in order to detect errors of translation, to characterize post-translational modifications and to assign diulphide bonds. However, the extent to which peptide-mass information can be used alone to identify unknown sample proteins, independent of other analytical methods such as protein sequence analysis, has remained largely unexplored. RESULTS: We report here on the development of the molecular weight search (MOWSE) peptide-mass database at the SERC Daresbury Laboratory. Practical experience has shown that sample proteins can be uniquely identified from a few as three or four experimentally determined peptide masses when these are screened against a fragment database that is derived from over 50 000 proteins. Experimental errors of a few Daltons are tolerated by the scoring algorithms, thus permitting the use of inexpensive time-of-flight mass spectrometers. As with other types of physical data, such as amino-acid composition or linear sequence, peptide masses provide a set of determinants that are sufficiently discriminating to identify or match unknown sample proteins. CONCLUSION: Peptide-mass fingerprints can prove as discriminating as linear peptide sequences, but can be obtained in a fraction of the time using less protein. In many cases, this allows for a rapid identification of a sample protein before committing it to protein sequence analysis. Fragment masses also provide information, at the protein level, that is complementary to the information provided by large-scale DNA sequencing or mapping projects.},

Using SEQUEST search results for spectra generated from a sample of known protein components, we demonstrate that the computed probabilities are accurate and have high power to discriminate between correctly and incorrectly assigned peptides. This analysis makes it possible to filter large volumes of MS/MS database search results with predictable false identification error rates and can serve as a common standard by which the results of different research groups are compared.},

abstract = {Motivation: Experimental techniques in proteomics have seen rapid development over the last few years. Volume and complexity of the data have both been growing at a similar rate. Accordingly, data management and analysis are one of the major challenges in proteomics. Flexible algorithms are required to handle changing experimental setups and to assist in developing and validating new methods. In order to facilitate these studies, it would be desirable to have a flexible toolbox' of versatile and user-friendly applications allowing for rapid construction of computational workflows in proteomics. Results: We describe a set of tools for proteomics data analysis--TOPP, The OpenMS Proteomics Pipeline. TOPP provides a set of computational tools which can be easily combined into analysis pipelines even by non-experts and can be used in proteomics workflows. These applications range from useful utilities (file format conversion, peak picking) over wrapper applications for known applications (e.g. Mascot) to completely new algorithmic techniques for data reduction and data analysis. We anticipate that TOPP will greatly facilitate rapid prototyping of proteomics data evaluation pipelines. As such, we describe the basic concepts and the current abilities of TOPP and illustrate these concepts in the context of two example applications: the identification of peptides from a raw dataset through database search and the complex analysis of a standard addition experiment for the absolute quantitation of biomarkers. The latter example demonstrates TOPP's ability to construct flexible analysis pipelines in support of complex experimental setups. Availability: The TOPP components are available as open-source software under the lesser GNU public license (LGPL).

abstract = {Arabidopsis thaliana, a small annual plant belonging to the mustard family, is the subject of study by an estimated 7000 researchers around the world. In addition to the large body of genetic, physiological and biochemical data gathered for this plant, it will be the first higher plant genome to be completely sequenced, with completion expected at the end of the year 2000. The sequencing effort has been coordinated by an international collaboration, the Arabidopsis Genome Initiative (AGI). The rationale for intensive investigation of Arabidopsis is that it is an excellent model for higher plants. In order to maximize use of the knowledge gained about this plant, there is a need for a comprehensive database and information retrieval and analysis system that will provide user-friendly access to Arabidopsis information. This paper describes the initial steps we have taken toward realizing these goals in a project called The Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR) (www.arabidopsis.org).},

abstract = {We describe an algorithm for the automated statistical analysis of protein abundance ratios (ASAPRatio) of proteins contained in two samples. Proteins are labeled with distinct stable-isotope tags and fragmented, and the tagged peptide fragments are separated by liquid chromatography (LC) and analyzed by electrospray ionization (ESI) tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). The algorithm utilizes the signals recorded for the different isotopic forms of peptides of identical sequence and numerical and statistical methods, such as Savitzky-Golay smoothing filters, statistics for weighted samples, and Dixon's test for outliers, to evaluate protein abundance ratios and their associated errors. The algorithm also provides a statistical assessment to distinguish proteins of significant abundance changes from a population of proteins of unchanged abundance. To evaluate its performance, two sets of LC-ESI-MS/MS data were analyzed by the ASAPRatio algorithm without human intervention, and the data were related to the expected and manually validated values. The utility of the ASAPRatio program was clearly demonstrated by its speed and the accuracy of the generated protein abundance ratios and by its capability to identify specific core components of the RNA polymerase II transcription complex within a high background of copurifying proteins.},

@article{Saito2007,
abstract = {BACKGROUND:Comprehensive description of the behavior of cellular components in a quantitative manner is essential for systematic understanding of biological events. Recent LC-MS/MS (tandem mass spectrometry coupled with liquid chromatography) technology, in combination with the SILAC (Stable Isotope Labeling by Amino acids in Cell culture) method, has enabled us to make relative quantitation at the proteome level. The recent report by Blagoev et al. (Nat. Biotechnol., 22, 1139-1145, 2004) indicated that this method was also applicable for the time-course analysis of cellular signaling events. Relative quatitation can easily be performed by calculating the ratio of peak intensities corresponding to differentially labeled peptides in the MS spectrum. As currently available software requires some GUI applications and is time-consuming, it is not suitable for processing large-scale proteome data.RESULTS:To resolve this difficulty, we developed an algorithm that automatically detects the peaks in each spectrum. Using this algorithm, we developed a software tool named AYUMS that automatically identifies the peaks corresponding to differentially labeled peptides, compares these peaks, calculates each of the peak ratios in mixed samples, and integrates them into one data sheet. This software has enabled us to dramatically save time for generation of the final report.CONCLUSION:AYUMS is a useful software tool for comprehensive quantitation of the proteome data generated by LC-MS/MS analysis. This software was developed using Java and runs on Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X. Please contact ayums@ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp if you are interested in the application.

abstract = {A rapid method for the identification of known proteins separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis is described in which molecular masses of peptide fragments are used to search a protein sequence database. The peptides are generated by in situ reduction, alkylation, and tryptic digestion of proteins electroblotted from two-dimensional gels. Masses are determined at the subpicomole level by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry of the unfractionated digest. A computer program has been developed that searches the protein sequence database for multiple peptides of individual proteins that match the measured masses. To ensure that the most recent database updates are included, a theoretical digest of the entire database is generated each time the program is executed. This method facilitates simultaneous processing of a large number of two-dimensional gel spots. The method was applied to a two-dimensional gel of a crude Escherichia coli extract that was electroblotted onto poly(vinylidene difluoride) membrane. Ten randomly chosen spots were analyzed. With as few as three peptide masses, each protein was uniquely identified from over 91,000 protein sequences. All identifications were verified by concurrent N-terminal sequencing of identical spots from a second blot. One of the spots contained an N-terminally blocked protein that required enzymatic cleavage, peptide separation, and Edman degradation for confirmation of its identity.},

@article{Stanke2008,
abstract = {Motivation: Computational annotation of protein coding genes in genomic DNA is a widely used and essential tool for analyzing newly sequenced genomes. However, current methods suffer from inaccuracy and do poorly with certain types of genes. Including additional sources of evidence of the existence and structure of genes can improve the quality of gene predictions. For many eukaryotic genomes, expressed sequence tags (ESTs) are available as evidence for genes. Related genomes that have been sequenced, annotated, and aligned to the target genome provide evidence of existence and structure of genes.Results: We incorporate several different evidence sources into the gene finder AUGUSTUS. The sources of evidence are gene and transcript annotations from related species syntenically mapped to the target genome using TransMap, evolutionary conservation of DNA, mRNA and ESTs of the target species, and retroposed genes. The predictions include alternative splice variants where evidence supports it. Using only ESTs we were able to correctly predict at least one splice form exactly correct in 57\% of human genes. Also using evidence from other species and human mRNAs, this number rises to 77\%. Syntenic mapping is well-suited to annotate genomes closely related to genomes that are already annotated or for which extensive transcript evidence is available. Native cDNA evidence is most helpful when the alignments are used as compound information rather than independent positionwise information.Availability: AUGUSTUS is open source and available at http://augustus.gobics.de. The gene predictions for human can be browsed and downloaded at the UCSC Genome Browser (http://genome.ucsc.edu)Contact: mstanke@gwdg.deSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

abstract = {The completion of the sequencing of the mouse genome promises to help predict human genes with greater accuracy. While current ab initio gene prediction programs are remarkably sensitive (i.e., they predict at least a fragment of most genes), their specificity is often low, predicting a large number of false-positive genes in the human genome. Sequence conservation at the protein level with the mouse genome can help eliminate some of those false positives. Here we describe SGP2, a gene prediction program that combines ab initio gene prediction with TBLASTX searches between two genome sequences to provide both sensitive and specific gene predictions. The accuracy of SGP2 when used to predict genes by comparing the human and mouse genomes is assessed on a number of data sets, including single-gene data sets, the highly curated human chromosome 22 predictions, and entire genome predictions from ENSEMBL. Results indicate that SGP2 outperforms purely ab initio gene prediction methods. Results also indicate that SGP2 works about as well with 3x shotgun data as it does with fully assembled genomes. SGP2 provides a high enough specificity that its predictions can be experimentally verified at a reasonable cost. SGP2 was used to generate a complete set of gene predictions on both the human and mouse by comparing the genomes of these two species. Our results suggest that another few thousand human and mouse genes currently not in ENSEMBL are worth verifying experimentally.},

Peptide quantitation is based on MS peak intensity (measured in the FT MS), while peptide identification is performed in the MS/MS mode (measured in the LTQ linear ion trap). Accuracy of the protein abundance is enhanced by a novel scoring procedure, allowing filtering of less reliable measurements of peptide abundances. The performance of QN is illustrated in the relative quantitative analysis of M. acetivorans C2A cultures grown with carbon monoxide vs methanol as substrate. Roughly 1000 proteins were quantitated with an average CV of 9\% for the protein abundance ratios. QN performs quantitation without manual intervention, does not require high processing power, and generates files compatible with the Guidelines for Proteomic Data Publication.

@article{Hulsen2008,
abstract = {BACKGROUND:In many genomics projects, numerous lists containing biological identifiers are produced. Often it is useful to see the overlap between different lists, enabling researchers to quickly observe similarities and differences between the data sets they are analyzing. One of the most popular methods to visualize the overlap and differences between data sets is the Venn diagram: a diagram consisting of two or more circles in which each circle corresponds to a data set, and the overlap between the circles corresponds to the overlap between the data sets. Venn diagrams are especially useful when they are 'area-proportional' i.e. the sizes of the circles and the overlaps correspond to the sizes of the data sets. Currently there are no programs available that can create area-proportional Venn diagrams connected to a wide range of biological databases.RESULTS:We designed a web application named BioVenn to summarize the overlap between two or three lists of identifiers, using area-proportional Venn diagrams. The user only needs to input these lists of identifiers in the textboxes and push the submit button. Parameters like colors and text size can be adjusted easily through the web interface. The position of the text can be adjusted by 'drag-and-drop' principle. The output Venn diagram can be shown as an SVG or PNG image embedded in the web application, or as a standalone SVG or PNG image. The latter option is useful for batch queries. Besides the Venn diagram, BioVenn outputs lists of identifiers for each of the resulting subsets. If an identifier is recognized as belonging to one of the supported biological databases, the output is linked to that database. Finally, BioVenn can map Affymetrix and EntrezGene identifiers to Ensembl genes.CONCLUSION:BioVenn is an easy-to-use web application to generate area-proportional Venn diagrams from lists of biological identifiers. It supports a wide range of identifiers from the most used biological databases currently available. Its implementation on the World Wide Web makes it available for use on any computer with internet connection, independent of operating system and without the need to install programs locally.

abstract = {We describe an algorithm for the automated statistical analysis of protein abundance ratios (ASAPRatio) of proteins contained in two samples. Proteins are labeled with distinct stable-isotope tags and fragmented, and the tagged peptide fragments are separated by liquid chromatography (LC) and analyzed by electrospray ionization (ESI) tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). The algorithm utilizes the signals recorded for the different isotopic forms of peptides of identical sequence and numerical and statistical methods, such as Savitzky−Golay smoothing filters, statistics for weighted samples, and Dixon's test for outliers, to evaluate protein abundance ratios and their associated errors. The algorithm also provides a statistical assessment to distinguish proteins of significant abundance changes from a population of proteins of unchanged abundance. To evaluate its performance, two sets of LC-ESI-MS/MS data were analyzed by the ASAPRatio algorithm without human intervention, and the data were related to the expected and manually validated values. The utility of the ASAPRatio program was clearly demonstrated by its speed and the accuracy of the generated protein abundance ratios and by its capability to identify specific core components of the RNA polymerase II transcription complex within a high background of copurifying proteins.},

abstract = {We have developed an algorithm for identifying proteins at the sub-microgram level without sequence determination by chemical degradation. The protein, usually isolated by one- or two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, is digested by enzymatic or chemical means and the masses of the resulting peptides are determined by mass spectrometry. The resulting mass profile, i.e., the list of the molecular masses of peptides produced by the digestion, serves as a fingerprint which uniquely defines a particular protein. This fingerprint may be used to search the database of known sequences to find proteins with a similar profile. If the protein is not yet sequenced the profile can serve as a unique marker. This provides a rapid and sensitive link between genomic sequences and 2D gel electrophoresis mapping of cellular proteins.},

abstract = {The flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana is an important model system for identifying genes and determining their functions. Here we report the analysis of the genomic sequence of Arabidopsis. The sequenced regions cover 115.4 megabases of the 125-megabase genome and extend into centromeric regions. The evolution of Arabidopsis involved a whole-genome duplication, followed by subsequent gene loss and extensive local gene duplications, giving rise to a dynamic genome enriched by lateral gene transfer from a cyanobacterial-like ancestor of the plastid. The genome contains 25,498 genes encoding proteins from 11,000 families, similar to the functional diversity of Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans--the other sequenced multicellular eukaryotes. Arabidopsis has many families of new proteins but also lacks several common protein families, indicating that the sets of common proteins have undergone differential expansion and contraction in the three multicellular eukaryotes. This is the first complete genome sequence of a plant and provides the foundations for more comprehensive comparison of conserved processes in all eukaryotes, identifying a wide range of plant-specific gene functions and establishing rapid systematic ways to identify genes for crop improvement.},

abstract = {The shotgun proteomic strategy based on digesting proteins into peptides and sequencing them using tandem mass spectrometry and automated database searching has become the method of choice for identifying proteins in most large scale studies. However, the peptide-centric nature of shotgun proteomics complicates the analysis and biological interpretation of the data especially in the case of higher eukaryote organisms. The same peptide sequence can be present in multiple different proteins or protein isoforms. Such shared peptides therefore can lead to ambiguities in determining the identities of sample proteins. In this article we illustrate the difficulties of interpreting shotgun proteomic data and discuss the need for common nomenclature and transparent informatic approaches. We also discuss related issues such as the state of protein sequence databases and their role in shotgun proteomic analysis, interpretation of relative peptide quantification data in the presence of multiple protein isoforms, the integration of proteomic and transcriptional data, and the development of a computational infrastructure for the integration of multiple diverse datasets.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: A large number of gene prediction programs for the human genome exist. These annotation tools use a variety of methods and data sources. In the recent ENCODE genome annotation assessment project (EGASP), some of the most commonly used and recently developed gene-prediction programs were systematically evaluated and compared on test data from the human genome. AUGUSTUS was among the tools that were tested in this project. RESULTS: AUGUSTUS can be used as an ab initio program, that is, as a program that uses only one single genomic sequence as input information. In addition, it is able to combine information from the genomic sequence under study with external hints from various sources of information. For EGASP, we used genomic sequence alignments as well as alignments to expressed sequence tags (ESTs) and protein sequences as additional sources of information. Within the category of ab initio programs AUGUSTUS predicted significantly more genes correctly than any other ab initio program. At the same time it predicted the smallest number of false positive genes and the smallest number of false positive exons among all ab initio programs. The accuracy of AUGUSTUS could be further improved when additional extrinsic data, such as alignments to EST, protein and/or genomic sequences, was taken into account. CONCLUSION: AUGUSTUS turned out to be the most accurate ab initio gene finder among the tested tools. Moreover it is very flexible because it can take information from several sources simultaneously into consideration.},

Three conceptually different methods to perform quantitative LC-MS experiments have been introduced. In the first, quantification is achieved by spectral counting, in the second via differential stable isotopic labeling, and in the third by using the ion current in label-free LC-MS measurements. We discuss here advantages and challenges of each quantification approach and assess available software solutions with respect to their instrument compatibility and processing functionality. This review therefore serves as a starting point for researchers to choose an appropriate software solution for quantitative proteomic experiments based on their experimental and analytical requirements.},

In spite of tremendous recent advances in computational gene finding, comprehensive annotation remains a challenge. Peptide mass spectrometry is a powerful tool for researching the dynamic proteome and suggests an attractive approach to discover and validate protein-coding genes. We present algorithms to construct and efficiently search spectra against a genomic database, with no prior knowledge of encoded proteins. By searching a corpus of 18.5 million tandem mass spectra (MS/MS) from human proteomic samples, we validate 39,000 exons and 11,000 introns at the level of translation. We present translation-level evidence for novel or extended exons in 16 genes, confirm translation of 224 hypothetical proteins, and discover or confirm over 40 alternative splicing events. Polymorphisms are efficiently encoded in our database, allowing us to observe variant alleles for 308 coding SNPs. Finally, we demonstrate the use of mass spectrometry to improve automated gene prediction, adding 800 correct exons to our predictions using a simple rescoring strategy. Our results demonstrate that proteomic profiling should play a role in any genome sequencing project.},

abstract = {Research areas such as proteomics and metabolomics are driving the demand for mass spectrometers that have high performance but modest power requirements, size, and cost. This paper describes such an instrument, the Orbitrap, based on a new type of mass analyzer invented by Makarov. The Orbitrap operates by radially trapping ions about a central spindle electrode. An outer barrel-like electrode is coaxial with the inner spindlelike electrode and mass/charge values are measured from the frequency of harmonic ion oscillations, along the axis of the electric field, undergone by the orbitally trapped ions. This axial frequency is independent of the energy and spatial spread of the ions. Ion frequencies are measured non-destructively by acquisition of time-domain image current transients, with subsequent fast Fourier transforms (FFTs) being used to obtain the mass spectra. In addition to describing the Orbitrap mass analyzer, this paper also describes a complete Orbitrap-based mass spectrometer, equipped with an electrospray ionization source (ESI). Ions are transferred from the ESI source through three stages of differential pumping using RF guide quadrupoles. The third quadrupole, pressurized to less than 10(-3) Torr with collision gas, acts as an ion accumulator; ion/neutral collisions slow the ions and cause them to pool in an axial potential well at the end of the quadrupole. Ion bunches are injected from this pool into the Orbitrap analyzer for mass analysis. The ion injection process is described in a simplified way, including a description of electrodynamic squeezing, field compensation for the effects of the ion injection slit, and criteria for orbital stability. Features of the Orbitrap at its present stage of development include high mass resolution (up to 150,000), large space charge capacity, high mass accuracy (2-5 ppm), a mass/charge range of at least 6000, and dynamic range greater than 10(3). Applications based on electrospray ionization are described, including characterization of transition-metal complexes, oligosaccharides, peptides, and proteins. Use is also made of the high-resolution capabilities of the Orbitrap to confirm the presence of metaclusters of serine octamers in ESI mass spectra and to perform H/D exchange experiments on these ions in the storage quadrupole.},

abstract = {Recent sequencing efforts have targeted the gene-rich regions of the maize (Zea mays L.) genome. We report the release of an improved assembly of maize assembled genomic islands (MAGIs). The 114,173 resulting contigs have been subjected to computational and physical quality assessments. Comparisons to the sequences of maize bacterial artificial chromosomes suggest that at least 97\% (160 of 165) of MAGIs are correctly assembled. Because the rates at which junction-testing PCR primers for genomic survey sequences (90-92\%) amplify genomic DNA are not significantly different from those of control primers ( approximately 91\%), we conclude that a very high percentage of genic MAGIs accurately reflect the structure of the maize genome. EST alignments, ab initio gene prediction, and sequence similarity searches of the MAGIs are available at the Iowa State University MAGI web site. This assembly contains 46,688 ab initio predicted genes. The expression of almost half (628 of 1,369) of a sample of the predicted genes that lack expression evidence was validated by RT-PCR. Our analyses suggest that the maize genome contains between approximately 33,000 and approximately 54,000 expressed genes. Approximately 5\% (32 of 628) of the maize transcripts discovered do not have detectable paralogs among maize ESTs or detectable homologs from other species in the GenBank NR nucleotide/protein database. Analyses therefore suggest that this assembly of the maize genome contains approximately 350 previously uncharacterized expressed genes. We hypothesize that these "orphans" evolved quickly during maize evolution and/or domestication.},

@article{PAPPIN1993,
abstract = {Background:Developments in ‘soft’ ionisation techniques have revolutionized mass-spectro-metric approaches for the analysis of protein structure. For more than a decade, such techniques have been used, in conjuction with digestion b specific proteases, to produce accurate peptide molecular weight ‘fingerprints’ of proteins. These fingerprints have commonly been used to screen known proteins, in order to detect errors of translation, to characterize post-translational modifications and to assign diulphide bonds. However, the extent to which peptide-mass information can be used alone to identify unknown sample proteins, independent of other analytical methods such as protein sequence analysis, has remained largely unexplored. Results: We report here on the development of the molecular weight search (MOWSE) peptide-mass database at the SERC Daresbury Laboratory. Practical experience has shown that sample proteins can be uniquely identified from a few as three or four experimentally determined peptide masses when these are screened against a fragment database that is derived from over 50 000 proteins. Experimental errors of a few Daltons are tolerated by the scoring algorithms, thus permitting the use of inexpensive time-of-flight mass spectrometers. As with other types of physical data, such as amino-acid composition or linear sequence, peptide masses provide a set of determinants that are sufficiently discriminating to identify or match unknown sample proteins. Conclusion: Peptide-mass fingerprints can prove as discriminating as linear peptide sequences, but can be obtained in a fraction of the time using less protein. In many cases, this allows for a rapid identification of a sample protein before committing it to protein sequence analysis. Fragment masses also provide information, at the protein level, that is complementary to the information provided by large-scale DNA sequencing or mapping projects.},

abstract = {A new high-throughput computational strategy was established that improves genomic data mining from MS experiments. The MS/MS data were analyzed by the SEQUEST search algorithm and a combination of de novo amino acid sequencing in conjunction with an error-tolerant database search tool, operating on a 256 processor computer cluster. The error-tolerant search tool, previously established as GenomicPeptideFinder (GPF), enables detection of intron-split and/or alternatively spliced peptides from MS/MS data when deduced from genomic DNA. Isolated thylakoid membranes from the eukaryotic green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii were separated by 1-D SDS gel electrophoresis, protein bands were excised from the gel, digested in-gel with trypsin and analyzed by coupling nano-flow LC with MS/MS. The concerted action of SEQUEST and GPF allowed identification of 2622 distinct peptides. In total 448 peptides were identified by GPF analysis alone, including 98 intron-split peptides, resulting in the identification of novel proteins, improved annotation of gene models, and evidence of alternative splicing.},

abstract = {Gene annotation underpins genome science. Most often protein coding sequence is inferred from the genome based on transcript evidence and computational predictions. While generally correct, gene models suffer from errors in reading frame, exon border definition, and exon identification. To ascertain the error rate of Arabidopsis thaliana gene models, we isolated proteins from a sample of Arabidopsis tissues and determined the amino acid sequences of 144,079 distinct peptides by tandem mass spectrometry. The peptides corresponded to 1 or more of 3 different translations of the genome: a 6-frame translation, an exon splice-graph, and the currently annotated proteome. The majority of the peptides (126,055) resided in existing gene models (12,769 confirmed proteins), comprising 40\% of annotated genes. Surprisingly, 18,024 novel peptides were found that do not correspond to annotated genes. Using the gene finding program AUGUSTUS and 5,426 novel peptides that occurred in clusters, we discovered 778 new protein-coding genes and refined the annotation of an additional 695 gene models. The remaining 13,449 novel peptides provide high quality annotation (>99\% correct) for thousands of additional genes. Our observation that 18,024 of 144,079 peptides did not match current gene models suggests that 13\% of the Arabidopsis proteome was incomplete due to approximately equal numbers of missing and incorrect gene models.},

These and most other types of quantitative proteomics experiments using high-throughput technologies, such as LC-MS/MS, generate large amounts of raw MS data. This data needs to be processed efficiently and automatically, from the mass spectrometer to statistically evaluated protein identifications and abundance ratios. This paper describes in detail an approach to the automated analysis of uniformly (14)N/(15)N-labeled proteins using MASCOT peptide identification in conjunction with the trans-proteomic pipeline (TPP) and a few scripts to integrate the analysis workflow. Two large proteomic datasets from uniformly labeled Arabidopsis thaliana were used to illustrate the analysis pipeline.

Our algorithm uses small regions of peptide sequence information which are automatically deduced from de novo amino acid sequence predictions together with the molecular mass information of the precursor ion.

Fragments of the predicted amino acid sequence are aligned with each of the six frames of the translated genome and the precursor mass information is used to assemble the corresponding tryptic peptides using the sequence as a matrix. Hereby, intron-split peptides can be gathered and in turn verified by mass spectrometric data interpretation tools such as Sequest.},

abstract = {A method to correlate the uninterpreted tandem mass spectra of peptides produced under low energy (10-50 eV) collision conditions with amino acid sequences in the Genpept database has been developed. In this method the protein database is searched to identify linear amino acid sequences within a mass tolerance of ± 1 u of the precursor ion molecular weight. A cross-correlation function is then used to provide a measurement of similarity between the mass-to-charge ratios for the fragment ions predicted from amino acid sequences obtained from the database and the fragment ions observed in the tandem mass spectrum. In general, a difference greater than 0.1 between the normalized cross-correlation functions of the first- and second-ranked search results indicates a successful match between sequence and spectrum. Searches of species-specific protein databases with tandem mass spectra acquired from peptides obtained from the enzymatically digested total proteins of E. coli and S. cerevisiae cells allowed matching of the spectra to amino acid sequences within proteins of these organisms. The approach described in this manuscript provides a convenient method to interpret tandem mass spectra with known sequences in a protein database.},

It is a model system for studying chloroplast-based photosynthesis, as well as the structure, assembly, and function of eukaryotic flagella (cilia), which were inherited from the common ancestor of plants and animals, but lost in land plants. We sequenced the approximately 120-megabase nuclear genome of Chlamydomonas and performed comparative phylogenomic analyses, identifying genes encoding uncharacterized proteins that are likely associated with the function and biogenesis of chloroplasts or eukaryotic flagella. Analyses of the Chlamydomonas genome advance our understanding of the ancestral eukaryotic cell, reveal previously unknown genes associated with photosynthetic and flagellar functions, and establish links between ciliopathy and the composition and function of flagella.},

@article{Perkins1999,
abstract = {Several algorithms have been described in the literature for protein identification by searching a sequence database using mass spectrometry data. In some approaches, the experimental data are peptide molecular weights from the digestion of a protein by an enzyme. Other approaches use tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) data from one or more peptides. Still others combine mass data with amino acid sequence data. We present results from a new computer program, Mascot, which integrates all three types of search. The scoring algorithm is probability based, which has a number of advantages: (i) A simple rule can be used to judge whether a result is significant or not. This is particularly useful in guarding against false positives. (ii) Scores can be com pared with those from other types of search, such as sequence homology. (iii) Search parameters can be readily optimised by iteration. The strengths and limitations of probability-based scoring are discussed, particularly in the context of high throughput, fully automated protein identification.},

@article{Castellana2010,
abstract = {Proteogenomics has emerged as a field at the junction of genomics and proteomics. It is a loose collection of technologies that allow the search of tandem mass spectra against genomic databases to identify and characterize protein-coding genes. Proteogenomic peptides provide invaluable information for gene annotation, which is difficult or impossible to ascertain using standard annotation methods. Examples include confirmation of translation, reading-frame determination, identification of gene and exon boundaries, evidence for post-translational processing, identification of splice-forms including alternative splicing, and also, prediction of completely novel genes. For proteogenomics to deliver on its promise, however, it must overcome a number of technological hurdles, including speed and accuracy of peptide identification, construction and search of specialized databases, correction of sampling bias, and others. This article reviews the state of the art of the field, focusing on the current successes, and the role of computation in overcoming these challenges. We describe how technological and algorithmic advances have already enabled large-scale proteogenomic studies in many model organisms, including arabidopsis, yeast, fly, and human. We also provide a preview of the field going forward, describing early efforts in tackling the problems of complex gene structures, searching against genomes of related species, and immunoglobulin gene reconstruction.},

At the core of this methodology is a multiplexed set of isobaric reagents that yield amine-derivatized peptides. The derivatized peptides are indistinguishable in MS, but exhibit intense low-mass MS/MS signature ions that support quantitation. In this study, we have examined the global protein expression of a wild-type yeast strain and the isogenic upf1Delta and xrn1Delta mutant strains that are defective in the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay and the general 5' to 3' decay pathways, respectively. We also demonstrate the use of 4-fold multiplexing to enable relative protein measurements simultaneously with determination of absolute levels of a target protein using synthetic isobaric peptide standards. We find that inactivation of Upf1p and Xrn1p causes common as well as unique effects on protein expression.},

This performance level is well above that of the publicly available chloroplast localization predictor PSORT. Cleavage sites are predicted using a scoring matrix derived by an automatic motif-finding algorithm. Approximately 60\% of the known cleavage sites in our sequence collection were predicted to within +/-2 residues from the cleavage sites given in SWISS-PROT. An analysis of 715 Arabidopsis thaliana sequences from SWISS-PROT suggests that the ChloroP method should be useful for the identification of putative transit peptides in genome-wide sequence data.

abstract = {A computer searching algorithm has been used to identify protein sequences in the Protein Information Resource (PIR) database with peptide mass information (mass map) obtained from proteolytic digests of proteins analyzed by microcapillary high-performance liquid chromatography electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. A theoretical analysis of the cytochrome c family demonstrates the ability to identify protein sequences in the PIR database with a high degree of accuracy using a set of six predicted tryptic peptide masses. This method was also applied to experimentally determined peptide masses for a small GTP-binding protein, a protein from pig uterus, the human sex steroid binding protein, and a thermostable DNA polymerase. The results demonstrate that a set of observed masses which is less than 50\% of the total number of predicted masses can be used to identify a protein sequence in the database. For the analysis presented in this paper, a mass matching tolerance of 1 amu is used. Under these conditions, mass maps created by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry and matrix-assisted laser desorption time-of-flight would also be applicable. In cases where multiple matches are observed or verification of the protein identification is needed, tandem mass spectrometry sequencing can be used to establish sequence similarity.},

In spite of tremendous recent advances in computational gene finding, comprehensive annotation remains a challenge. Peptide mass spectrometry is a powerful tool for researching the dynamic proteome and suggests an attractive approach to discover and validate protein-coding genes. We present algorithms to construct and efficiently search spectra against a genomic database, with no prior knowledge of encoded proteins. By searching a corpus of 18.5 million tandem mass spectra (MS/MS) from human proteomic samples, we validate 39,000 exons and 11,000 introns at the level of translation. We present translation-level evidence for novel or extended exons in 16 genes, confirm translation of 224 hypothetical proteins, and discover or confirm over 40 alternative splicing events. Polymorphisms are efficiently encoded in our database, allowing us to observe variant alleles for 308 coding SNPs. Finally, we demonstrate the use of mass spectrometry to improve automated gene prediction, adding 800 correct exons to our predictions using a simple rescoring strategy. Our results demonstrate that proteomic profiling should play a role in any genome sequencing project.},

In the past two years, dual-genome de novo predictors, which exploit local rates and patterns of mutation inferred from alignments between two genomes, have led to significant improvements in accuracy. Systems that exploit more than two genomes simultaneously have only recently begun to appear and are not yet competitive on practical tasks, but offer the greatest hope for near-term improvements. Dual-genome de novo prediction for compact eukaryotic genomes such as those of Arabidopsis thaliana and Caenorhabditis elegans is already quite accurate. Although mammalian gene prediction lags behind in accuracy, it is yielding ever more useful results. Coupled with significant improvements in pseudogene detection methods, which have eliminated many false positives, we have reached the point where de novo gene predictions are being used as hypotheses to drive experimental annotation via systematic RT-PCR and sequencing.},

abstract = {MS/MS and associated database search algorithms are essential proteomic tools for identifying peptides. Due to their widespread use, it is now time to perform a systematic analysis of the various algorithms currently in use. Using blood specimens used in the HUPO Plasma Proteome Project, we have evaluated five search algorithms with respect to their sensitivity and specificity, and have also accurately benchmarked them based on specified false-positive (FP) rates. Spectrum Mill and SEQUEST performed well in terms of sensitivity, but were inferior to MASCOT, X!Tandem, and Sonar in terms of specificity. Overall, MASCOT, a probabilistic search algorithm, correctly identified most peptides based on a specified FP rate. The rescoring algorithm, PeptideProphet, enhanced the overall performance of the SEQUEST algorithm, as well as provided predictable FP error rates. Ideally, score thresholds should be calculated for each peptide spectrum or minimally, derived from a reversed-sequence search as demonstrated in this study based on a validated data set. The availability of open-source search algorithms, such as X!Tandem, makes it feasible to further improve the validation process (manual or automatic) on the basis of "consensus scoring", i.e., the use of multiple (at least two) search algorithms to reduce the number of FPs. complement.},

The method is based on a class of new chemical reagents termed isotope-coded affinity tags (ICATs) and tandem mass spectrometry. Using this strategy, we compared protein expression in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, using either ethanol or galactose as a carbon source. The measured differences in protein expression correlated with known yeast metabolic function under glucose-repressed conditions. The method is redundant if multiple cysteinyl residues are present, and the relative quantification is highly accurate because it is based on stable isotope dilution techniques. The ICAT approach should provide a widely applicable means to compare quantitatively global protein expression in cells and tissues.},

abstract = {The use and development of post-genomic tools naturally depends on large-scale genome sequencing projects. The usefulness of post-genomic applications is dependent on the accuracy of genome annotations, for which the correct identification of intron–exon borders in complex genomes of eukaryotic organisms is often an error-prone task. Although automated algorithms for predicting intron–exon structures are available, supporting exon evidence is necessary to achieve comprehensive genome annotation. Besides cDNA and EST support, peptides identified via MS/MS can be used as extrinsic evidence in a proteogenomic approach. We describe an improved version of the Genomic Peptide Finder (GPF), which aligns de novo predicted amino acid sequences to the genomic DNA sequence of an organism while correcting for peptide sequencing errors and accounting for the possibility of splicing. We have coupled GPF and the gene finding program AUGUSTUS in a way that provides automatic structural annotations of the Chlamydomonas reinhardtii genome, using highly unbiased GPF evidence. A comparison of the AUGUSTUS gene set incorporating GPF evidence to the standard JGI FM4 (Filtered Models 4) gene set reveals 932 GPF peptides that are not contained in the Filtered Models 4 gene set. Furthermore, the GPF evidence improved the AUGUSTUS gene models by altering 65 gene models and adding three previously unidentified genes.},

Here we develop and apply a general mass spectrometric technology for identification and quantitation of phosphorylation sites as a function of stimulus, time, and subcellular location. We have detected 6,600 phosphorylation sites on 2,244 proteins and have determined their temporal dynamics after stimulating HeLa cells with epidermal growth factor (EGF) and recorded them in the Phosida database. Fourteen percent of phosphorylation sites are modulated at least 2-fold by EGF, and these were classified by their temporal profiles. Surprisingly, a majority of proteins contain multiple phosphorylation sites showing different kinetics, suggesting that they serve as platforms for integrating signals. In addition to protein kinase cascades, the targets of reversible phosphorylation include ubiquitin ligases, guanine nucleotide exchange factors, and at least 46 different transcriptional regulators. The dynamic phosphoproteome provides a missing link in a global, integrative view of cellular regulation.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Accurate and automatic gene identification in eukaryotic genomic DNA is more than ever of crucial importance to efficiently exploit the large volume of assembled genome sequences available to the community. Automatic methods have always been considered less reliable than human expertise. This is illustrated in the EGASP project, where reference annotations against which all automatic methods are measured are generated by human annotators and experimentally verified. We hypothesized that replicating the accuracy of human annotators in an automatic method could be achieved by formalizing the rules and decisions that they use, in a mathematical formalism. RESULTS: We have developed Exogean, a flexible framework based on directed acyclic colored multigraphs (DACMs) that can represent biological objects (for example, mRNA, ESTs, protein alignments, exons) and relationships between them. Graphs are analyzed to process the information according to rules that replicate those used by human annotators. Simple individual starting objects given as input to Exogean are thus combined and synthesized into complex objects such as protein coding transcripts. CONCLUSION: We show here, in the context of the EGASP project, that Exogean is currently the method that best reproduces protein coding gene annotations from human experts, in terms of identifying at least one exact coding sequence per gene. We discuss current limitations of the method and several avenues for improvement.},

The Nar1 gene from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is clustered with five other genes for nitrate assimilation, all of them regulated by nitrate. Sequence analysis of genomic DNA and cDNA of Nar1 and comparative studies of strains having or lacking Nar1 have been performed. The deduced amino acid sequence indicates that Nar1 encodes a chloroplast membrane protein with substantial identity to putative formate and nitrite transporters in bacteria. Use of antibodies against NAR1 has corroborated its location in the plastidic membrane. Characterization of strains having or lacking this gene suggests that NAR1 is involved in nitrite transport in plastids, which is critical for cell survival under limiting nitrate conditions, and controls the amount of nitrate incorporated by the cells under limiting CO2 conditions.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Analysis of the viral genome for drug resistance mutations is state-of-the-art for guiding treatment selection for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected patients. These mutations alter the structure of viral target proteins and reduce or in the worst case completely inhibit the effect of antiretroviral compounds while maintaining the ability for effective replication. Modern anti-HIV-1 regimens comprise multiple drugs in order to prevent or at least delay the development of resistance mutations. However, commonly used HIV-1 genotype interpretation systems provide only classifications for single drugs. The EuResist initiative has collected data from about 18,500 patients to train three classifiers for predicting response to combination antiretroviral therapy, given the viral genotype and further information. In this work we compare different classifier fusion methods for combining the individual classifiers. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The individual classifiers yielded similar performance, and all the combination approaches considered performed equally well. The gain in performance due to combining methods did not reach statistical significance compared to the single best individual classifier on the complete training set. However, on smaller training set sizes (200 to 1,600 instances compared to 2,700) the combination significantly outperformed the individual classifiers (p<0.01; paired one-sided Wilcoxon test). Together with a consistent reduction of the standard deviation compared to the individual prediction engines this shows a more robust behavior of the combined system. Moreover, using the combined system we were able to identify a class of therapy courses that led to a consistent underestimation (about 0.05 AUC) of the system performance. Discovery of these therapy courses is a further hint for the robustness of the combined system. CONCLUSION: The combined EuResist prediction engine is freely available at http://engine.euresist.org.},

The criterion of maximizing the concordance may not be appropriate in certain applications. In practice, some applications may emphasize high sensitivity (e.g., clinical diagnostic tests) and others may emphasize high specificity (e.g., epidemiology screening studies). This paper considers effects of the decision threshold on sensitivity, specificity, and concordance for four classification methods: logistic regression, classification tree, Fisher's linear discriminant analysis, and a weighted k-nearest neighbor. We investigated the use of decision threshold adjustment to improve performance of either sensitivity or specificity of a classifier under specific conditions. We conducted a Monte Carlo simulation showing that as the decision threshold increases, the sensitivity decreases and the specificity increases; but, the concordance values in an interval around the maximum concordance are similar. For specified sensitivity and specificity levels, an optimal decision threshold might be determined in an interval around the maximum concordance that meets the specified requirement. Three example data sets were analyzed for illustrations.},

abstract = {Abstract\&nbsp;\&nbsp;Regression tends to give very unstable and unreliable regression weights when predictors are highly collinear. Several methods have been proposed to counter this problem. A subset of these do so by finding components that summarize the information in the predictors and the criterion variables. The present paper compares six such methods (two of which are almost completely new) to ordinary regression: Partial least Squares (PLS), Principal Component regression (PCR), Principle covariates regression, reduced rank regression, and two variants of what is called power regression. The comparison is mainly done by means of a series of simulation studies, in which data are constructed in various ways, with different degrees of collinearity and noise, and the methods are compared in terms of their capability of recovering the population regression weights, as well as their prediction quality for the complete population. It turns out that recovery of regression weights in situations with collinearity is often very poor by all methods, unless the regression weights lie in the subspace spanning the first few principal components of the predictor variables. In those cases, typically PLS and PCR give the best recoveries of regression weights. The picture is inconclusive, however, because, especially in the study with more real life like simulated data, PLS and PCR gave the poorest recoveries of regression weights in conditions with relatively low noise and collinearity. It seems that PLS and PCR are particularly indicated in cases with much collinearity, whereas in other cases it is better to use ordinary regression. As far as prediction is concerned: Prediction suffers far less from collinearity than recovery of the regression weights.},

We briefly discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each approach. For classification tasks, we derive new learning algorithms for the design of prediction systems by directly optimising the correlation coefficient. We observe and prove several results relating sensitivity and specificity of optimal systems. While the principles are general, we illustrate the applicability on specific problems such as protein secondary structure and signal peptide prediction.  Contact: pfbaldi@ics.uci.edu},

abstract = {Five methods for discrimination are described, namely Euclidean Distance to centroids (EDC), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) (based on the Mahalanobis distance and pooled variance covariance matrix), Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA) (based on the Mahalanobis distance and individual class variance covariance matrix — non-Bayesian form), Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) (using soft boundaries and Radial Basis Functions), and illustrated graphically as boundary methods. The performance of each method was determined using four synthetic datasets each consisting of 200 samples half belonging to one of two classes, and a further two synthetic datasets containing 400 samples, again equally split between the two classes. In datasets 1 to 3, five variables were distributed multinormally, in dataset 1 the classes are distributed roughly circularly but with a significant degree of overlap, in dataset 2, the distribution is in elongated hyperellipsoids with small overlap, and in dataset 3 there is a region of complete overlap between classes. In dataset 4 two variables are distributed in a crescent shape. In datasets 5 and 6, 100 variables were generated from multinormal populations, some of which were potential discriminators, however a large proportion of the variables were designed to be uninformative. The methods were optimised using a training set and their performance evaluated using a test set: this was repeated 100 times for different test and training set splits. The average \% correctly classified was computed for each class and model, as well as the model stability for each sample (the proportion of times the sample is classified into the same group over all 100 iterations). The conclusions are that the performance of the classifiers depends very much on the distribution of data. Approaches such as LVQ and SVMs that try to determine complex boundaries perform best when the data is not normally distributed such as in dataset 4, but can be prone to overfitting otherwise. QDA tends to perform best on multinormal data although it can be influenced by non-discriminative variables which show a difference in variance. It is recommended to look at the data structure prior to model building to determine the optimal type of model.},

In many applications of chemometrics e.g. in medicine and biology it is common for there to be unequal sample sizes in different groups. When class sizes are unequal the performance of some of these methods may be biased according to class size. This paper describes approaches for incorporating prior probabilities of class membership using Bayesian approaches to three of the methods LDA, QDA and SVM, either assuming equal probability or assuming that the relative sample sizes relate to the relative probabilities.

An analysis shows that this occurs because the computed net error gradient vector is dominated by the bigger class so much that the net error for the exemplars in the smaller class increases significantly in the initial iteration. The subsequent rate of convergence of the net error is very low. A modified technique for calculating a direction in weight-space which decreases the error for each class is presented. Using this algorithm, the rate of learning for two-class classification problems is accelerated by an order of magnitude.},

abstract = {Stevens’ theory of admissible statistics [Stevens, S. S. (1946). On the theory of scales of measurement. Science, 103, 677680] states that measurement levels should guide the choice of statistical test, such that the truth value of statements based on a statistical analysis remains invariant under admissible transformations of the data. Lord [Lord, F. M. (1953). On the statistical treatment of football numbers. American Psychologist, 8, 750–751] challenged this theory. In a thought experiment, a parametric test is performed on football numbers (identifying players: a nominal representation) to decide whether a sample from the machine issuing these numbers should be considered non-random. This is an apparently illegal test, since its outcomes are not invariant under admissible transformations for the nominal measurement level. Nevertheless, it results in a sensible conclusion: the number-issuing machine was tampered with. In the ensuing measurement-statistics debate Lord’s contribution has been influential, but has also led to much confusion. The present aim is to show that the thought experiment contains a serious flaw. First it is shown that the implicit assumption that the numbers are nominal is false. This disqualifies Lord’s argument as a valid counterexample to Stevens’ dictum. Second, it is argued that the football numbers do not represent just the nominal property of non-identity of the players; they also represent the amount of bias in the machine. It is a question about this property–not a property that relates to the identity of the football players–that the statistical test is concerned with. Therefore, only this property is relevant to Lord’s argument. We argue that the level of bias in the machine, indicated by the population mean, conforms to a bisymmetric structure, which means that it lies on an interval scale. In this light, Lord’s thought experiment–interpreted by many as a problematic counterexample to Stevens’ theory of admissible statistics–conforms perfectly to Stevens’ dictum.},

abstract = {The class imbalance problem is encountered in real-world applications of machine learning and results in a classifier's suboptimal performance. Researchers have rigorously studied the resampling, algorithms, and feature selection approaches to this problem. No systematic studies have been conducted to understand how well these methods combat the class imbalance problem and which of these methods best manage the different challenges posed by imbalanced data sets. In particular, feature selection has rarely been studied outside of text classification problems. Additionally, no studies have looked at the additional problem of learning from small samples. This paper presents a first systematic comparison of the three types of methods developed for imbalanced data classification problems and of seven feature selection metrics evaluated on small sample data sets from different applications. We evaluated the performance of these metrics using area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) and area under the precision-recall curve (PRC). We compared each metric on the average performance across all problems and on the likelihood of a metric yielding the best performance on a specific problem. We examined the performance of these metrics inside each problem domain. Finally, we evaluated the efficacy of these metrics to see which perform best across algorithms. Our results showed that signal-to-noise correlation coefficient (S2N) and Feature Assessment by Sliding Thresholds (FAST) are great candidates for feature selection in most applications, especially when selecting very small numbers of features.},

As these types of problems increase in complexity in terms of both the dimensions and the underlying structures of the data sets, the number of options with respect to different types of scaling and regression models also increases. In this article, three methods for multiway regression are compared: unfold partial least squares (PLS), multilinear PLS and multiway covariates regression (MCovR). All three methods differ either in the structural model imposed on the data or the way the model components are calculated. Three methods of scaling multiway arrays are also compared, along with the option of applying no scaling. Three data sets drawn from industrial processes are used in the comparison. The general conclusion is that the type of data and scaling used is more important than the type of regression model used in terms of predictive ability. The models do differ, however, in terms of interpretability.},

However, the data in real-world applications often are imbalanced class distribution, that is, most of the data are in majority class and little data are in minority class. In this case, if all the data are used to be the training data, the classifier tends to predict that most of the incoming data belongs to the majority class. Hence, it is important to select the suitable training data for classification in the imbalanced class distribution problem. In this paper, we propose cluster-based under-sampling approaches for selecting the representative data as training data to improve the classification accuracy for minority class and investigate the effect of under-sampling methods in the imbalanced class distribution environment.

If a random sample of their work (including scientific papers) produced before doing these courses were selected, half would probably contain violations of the underlying assumptions of the statistical techniques employed. 2. Some violations have little impact on the results or ecological conclusions; yet others increase type I or type II errors, potentially resulting in wrong ecological conclusions. Most of these violations can be avoided by applying better data exploration. These problems are especially troublesome in applied ecology, where management and policy decisions are often at stake. 3. Here, we provide a protocol for data exploration; discuss current tools to detect outliers, heterogeneity of variance, collinearity, dependence of observations, problems with interactions, double zeros in multivariate analysis, zero inflation in generalized linear modelling, and the correct type of relationships between dependent and independent variables; and provide advice on how to address these problems when they arise. We also address misconceptions about normality, and provide advice on data transformations. 4. Data exploration avoids type I and type II errors, among other problems, thereby reducing the chance of making wrong ecological conclusions and poor recommendations. It is therefore essential for good quality management and policy based on statistical analyses.},

In this article, three methods for multiway regression are compared: unfold partial least squares (PLS), multilinear PLS and multiway covariates regression (MCovR). All three methods differ either in the structural model imposed on the data or the way the model components are calculated. Three methods of scaling multiway arrays are also compared, along with the option of applying no scaling. Three data sets drawn from industrial processes are used in the comparison. The general conclusion is that the type of data and scaling used is more important than the type of regression model used in terms of predictive ability. The models do differ, however, in terms of interpretability.},

@article{Altmann2008a,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Analysis of the viral genome for drug resistance mutations is state-of-the-art for guiding treatment selection for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected patients. These mutations alter the structure of viral target proteins and reduce or in the worst case completely inhibit the effect of antiretroviral compounds while maintaining the ability for effective replication. Modern anti-HIV-1 regimens comprise multiple drugs in order to prevent or at least delay the development of resistance mutations. However, commonly used HIV-1 genotype interpretation systems provide only classifications for single drugs. The EuResist initiative has collected data from about 18,500 patients to train three classifiers for predicting response to combination antiretroviral therapy, given the viral genotype and further information. In this work we compare different classifier fusion methods for combining the individual classifiers. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The individual classifiers yielded similar performance, and all the combination approaches considered performed equally well. The gain in performance due to combining methods did not reach statistical significance compared to the single best individual classifier on the complete training set. However, on smaller training set sizes (200 to 1,600 instances compared to 2,700) the combination significantly outperformed the individual classifiers (p<0.01; paired one-sided Wilcoxon test). Together with a consistent reduction of the standard deviation compared to the individual prediction engines this shows a more robust behavior of the combined system. Moreover, using the combined system we were able to identify a class of therapy courses that led to a consistent underestimation (about 0.05 AUC) of the system performance. Discovery of these therapy courses is a further hint for the robustness of the combined system. CONCLUSION: The combined EuResist prediction engine is freely available at http://engine.euresist.org.},

abstract = {For classification problem, the training data will significantly influence the classification accuracy. However, the data in real-world applications often are imbalanced class distribution, that is, most of the data are in majority class and little data are in minority class. In this case, if all the data are used to be the training data, the classifier tends to predict that most of the incoming data belongs to the majority class. Hence, it is important to select the suitable training data for classification in the imbalanced class distribution problem. In this paper, we propose cluster-based under-sampling approaches for selecting the representative data as training data to improve the classification accuracy for minority class and investigate the effect of under-sampling methods in the imbalanced class distribution environment. The experimental results show that our cluster-based under-sampling approaches outperform the other under-sampling techniques in the previous studies.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Protein homology detection and sequence alignment are at the basis of protein structure prediction, function prediction and evolution. RESULTS: We have generalized the alignment of protein sequences with a profile hidden Markov model (HMM) to the case of pairwise alignment of profile HMMs. We present a method for detecting distant homologous relationships between proteins based on this approach. The method (HHsearch) is benchmarked together with BLAST, PSI-BLAST, HMMER and the profile-profile comparison tools PROF\_SIM and COMPASS, in an all-against-all comparison of a database of 3691 protein domains from SCOP 1.63 with pairwise sequence identities below 20\%.Sensitivity: When the predicted secondary structure is included in the HMMs, HHsearch is able to detect between 2.7 and 4.2 times more homologs than PSI-BLAST or HMMER and between 1.44 and 1.9 times more than COMPASS or PROF\_SIM for a rate of false positives of 10\%. Approximately half of the improvement over the profile-profile comparison methods is attributable to the use of profile HMMs in place of simple profiles. Alignment quality: Higher sensitivity is mirrored by an increased alignment quality. HHsearch produced 1.2, 1.7 and 3.3 times more good alignments ('balanced' score >0.3) than the next best method (COMPASS), and 1.6, 2.9 and 9.4 times more than PSI-BLAST, at the family, superfamily and fold level, respectively.Speed: HHsearch scans a query of 200 residues against 3691 domains in 33 s on an AMD64 2GHz PC. This is 10 times faster than PROF\_SIM and 17 times faster than COMPASS.},

First, not only is the volume of pure sequence and structure data growing, but its diversity is growing as well, leading to a disproportionate growth in the number of uncharacterized gene products. Consequently, established methods of gene and protein annotation, such as homology-based transfer, are annotating less data and in many cases are amplifying existing erroneous annotation. Second, there is a need for a functional annotation which is standardized and machine readable so that function prediction programs could be incorporated into larger workflows. This is problematic due to the subjective and contextual definition of protein function. Third, there is a need to assess the quality of function predictors. Again, the subjectivity of the term 'function' and the various aspects of biological function make this a challenging effort.

Most of these, however, display one or more sequence discontinuities known as stutters or stammers. The resulting coiled coils vary in length, in the number of chains participating, in the relative polarity of the contributing alpha-helical regions (parallel or antiparallel), and in the pitch length and handedness of the supercoil (left- or right-handed). Functionally, the concept that a coiled coil can act only as a static rod is no longer valid, and the range of roles that these structures have now been shown to exhibit has expanded rapidly in recent years. An important development has been the recognition that the delightful simplicity that exists between sequence and structure, and between structure and function, allows coiled coils with specialized features to be designed de novo.},

Although experimental structure determination methods are providing high-resolution structure information about a subset of the proteins, computational structure prediction methods will provide valuable information for the large fraction of sequences whose structures will not be determined experimentally. The first class of protein structure prediction methods, including threading and comparative modeling, rely on detectable similarity spanning most of the modeled sequence and at least one known structure. The second class of methods, de novo or ab initio methods, predict the structure from sequence alone, without relying on similarity at the fold level between the modeled sequence and any of the known structures. In this Viewpoint, we begin by describing the essential features of the methods, the accuracy of the models, and their application to the prediction and understanding of protein function, both for single proteins and on the scale of whole genomes. We then discuss the important role that protein structure prediction methods play in the growing worldwide effort in structural genomics.},

With 55,000 entries in the Protein Data Bank and about 500 new structures added each week, automated processing, comparison, and classification are necessary. A variety of methods use different representations, scoring functions, and optimization algorithms, and they generate contradictory results even for moderately distant structures. Sequence mutations, insertions, and deletions are accommodated by plastic deformations of the common core, retaining the precise geometry of the active site, and peripheral regions may refold completely. Therefore structure comparison methods that allow for flexibility and plasticity generate the most biologically meaningful alignments. Active research directions include both the search for fold invariant features and the modeling of structural transitions in evolution.

abstract = {Methods that predict membrane helices have become increasingly useful in the context of analyzing entire proteomes, as well as in everyday sequence analysis. Here, we analyzed 27 advanced and simple methods in detail. To resolve contradictions in previous works and to reevaluate transmembrane helix prediction algorithms, we introduced an analysis that distinguished between performance on redundancy-reduced high- and low-resolution data sets, established thresholds for significant differences in performance, and implemented both per-segment and per-residue analysis of membrane helix predictions. Although some of the advanced methods performed better than others, we showed in a thorough bootstrapping experiment based on various measures of accuracy that no method performed consistently best. In contrast, most simple hydrophobicity scale-based methods were significantly less accurate than any advanced method as they overpredicted membrane helices and confused membrane helices with hydrophobic regions outside of membranes. In contrast, the advanced methods usually distinguished correctly between membrane-helical and other proteins. Nonetheless, few methods reliably distinguished between signal peptides and membrane helices. We could not verify a significant difference in performance between eukaryotic and prokaryotic proteins. Surprisingly, we found that proteins with more than five helices were predicted at a significantly lower accuracy than proteins with five or fewer. The important implication is that structurally unsolved multispanning membrane proteins, which are often important drug targets, will remain problematic for transmembrane helix prediction algorithms. Overall, by establishing a standardized methodology for transmembrane helix prediction evaluation, we have resolved differences among previous works and presented novel trends that may impact the analysis of entire proteomes.},

@article{Lichtarge1996,
abstract = {X-ray or NMR structures of proteins are often derived without their ligands, and even when the structure of a full complex is available, the area of contact that is functionally and energetically significant may be a specialized subset of the geometric interface deduced from the spatial proximity between ligands. Thus, even after a structure is solved, it remains a major theoretical and experimental goal to localize protein functional interfaces and understand the role of their constituent residues. The evolutionary trace method is a systematic, transparent and novel predictive technique that identifies active sites and functional interfaces in proteins with known structure. It is based on the extraction of functionally important residues from sequence conservation patterns in homologous proteins, and on their mapping onto the protein surface to generate clusters identifying functional interfaces. The SH2 and SH3 modular signaling domains and the DNA binding domain of the nuclear hormone receptors provide tests for the accuracy and validity of our method. In each case, the evolutionary trace delineates the functional epitope and identifies residues critical to binding specificity. Based on mutational evolutionary analysis and on the structural homology of protein families, this simple and versatile approach should help focus site-directed mutagenesis studies of structure-function relationships in macromolecules, as well as studies of specificity in molecular recognition. More generally, it provides an evolutionary perspective for judging the functional or structural role of each residue in protein structure.},

@article{Voss2009,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: In bacteria, non-coding RNAs (ncRNA) are crucial regulators of gene expression, controlling various stress responses, virulence, and motility. Previous work revealed a relatively high number of ncRNAs in some marine cyanobacteria. However, for efficient genetic and biochemical analysis it would be desirable to identify a set of ncRNA candidate genes in model cyanobacteria that are easy to manipulate and for which extended mutant, transcriptomic and proteomic data sets are available. RESULTS: Here we have used comparative genome analysis for the biocomputational prediction of ncRNA genes and other sequence/structure-conserved elements in intergenic regions of the three unicellular model cyanobacteria Synechocystis PCC6803, Synechococcus elongatus PCC6301 and Thermosynechococcus elongatus BP1 plus the toxic Microcystis aeruginosa NIES843. The unfiltered numbers of predicted elements in these strains is 383, 168, 168, and 809, respectively, combined into 443 sequence clusters, whereas the numbers of individual elements with high support are 94, 56, 64, and 406, respectively. Removing also transposon-associated repeats, finally 78, 53, 42 and 168 sequences, respectively, are left belonging to 109 different clusters in the data set. Experimental analysis of selected ncRNA candidates in Synechocystis PCC6803 validated new ncRNAs originating from the fabF-hoxH and apcC-prmA intergenic spacers and three highly expressed ncRNAs belonging to the Yfr2 family of ncRNAs. Yfr2a promoter-luxAB fusions confirmed a very strong activity of this promoter and indicated a stimulation of expression if the cultures were exposed to elevated light intensities. CONCLUSION: Comparison to entries in Rfam and experimental testing of selected ncRNA candidates in Synechocystis PCC6803 indicate a high reliability of the current prediction, despite some contamination by the high number of repetitive sequences in some of these species. In particular, we identified in the four species altogether 8 new ncRNA homologs belonging to the Yfr2 family of ncRNAs. Modelling of RNA secondary structures indicated two conserved single-stranded sequence motifs that might be involved in RNA-protein interactions or in the recognition of target RNAs. Since our analysis has been restricted to find ncRNA candidates with a reasonable high degree of conservation among these four cyanobacteria, there might be many more, requiring direct experimental approaches for their identification.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Function prediction by transfer of annotation from the top database hit in a homology search has been shown to be prone to systematic error. Phylogenomic analysis reduces these errors by inferring protein function within the evolutionary context of the entire family. However, accuracy of function prediction for multi-domain proteins depends on all members having the same overall domain structure. By contrast, most common homolog detection methods are optimized for retrieving local homologs, and do not address this requirement. RESULTS: We present FlowerPower, a novel clustering algorithm designed for the identification of global homologs as a precursor to structural phylogenomic analysis. Similar to methods such as PSIBLAST, FlowerPower employs an iterative approach to clustering sequences. However, rather than using a single HMM or profile to expand the cluster, FlowerPower identifies subfamilies using the SCI-PHY algorithm and then selects and aligns new homologs using subfamily hidden Markov models. FlowerPower is shown to outperform BLAST, PSI-BLAST and the UCSC SAM-Target 2K methods at discrimination between proteins in the same domain architecture class and those having different overall domain structures. CONCLUSION: Structural phylogenomic analysis enables biologists to avoid the systematic errors associated with annotation transfer; clustering sequences based on sharing the same domain architecture is a critical first step in this process. FlowerPower is shown to consistently identify homologous sequences having the same domain architecture as the query.

This unprecedented high proteome coverage for a complex eukaryote was achieved by combining sample diversity, multidimensional biochemical fractionation and analysis-driven experimentation feedback loops, whereby data collection is guided by statistical analysis of prior data. We show that high-quality proteomics data provide crucial information to amend genome annotation and to confirm many predicted gene models. We also present experimentally identified proteotypic peptides matching approximately 50\% of D. melanogaster gene models.

The program includes newly developed functionalities to analyze LC-MS data such as feature extraction and quantification, LC-MS similarity analysis, LC-MS alignment of multiple datasets, and intensity normalization. These program routines extract profiles of measured features and comprise tools for clustering and classification analysis of the profiles. SuperHirn was applied in an MS1-based profiling approach to a benchmark LC-MS dataset of complex protein mixtures with defined concentration changes. We show that the program automatically detects profiling trends in an unsupervised manner and is able to associate proteins to their correct theoretical dilution profile.},

abstract = {The Trans-Proteomic Pipeline (TPP) is a suite of software tools for the analysis of MS/MS data sets. The tools encompass most of the steps in a proteomic data analysis workflow in a single, integrated software system. Specifically, the TPP supports all steps from spectrometer output file conversion to protein-level statistical validation, including quantification by stable isotope ratios. We describe here the full workflow of the TPP and the tools therein, along with an example on a sample data set, demonstrating that the setup and use of the tools are straightforward and well supported and do not require specialized informatic resources or knowledge.},

abstract = {Efficient analysis of very large amounts of raw data for peptide identification and protein quantification is a principal challenge in mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics. Here we describe MaxQuant, an integrated suite of algorithms specifically developed for high-resolution, quantitative MS data. Using correlation analysis and graph theory, MaxQuant detects peaks, isotope clusters and stable amino acid isotope-labeled (SILAC) peptide pairs as three-dimensional objects in m/z, elution time and signal intensity space. By integrating multiple mass measurements and correcting for linear and nonlinear mass offsets, we achieve mass accuracy in the p.p.b. range, a sixfold increase over standard techniques. We increase the proportion of identified fragmentation spectra to 73\% for SILAC peptide pairs via unambiguous assignment of isotope and missed-cleavage state and individual mass precision. MaxQuant automatically quantifies several hundred thousand peptides per SILAC-proteome experiment and allows statistically robust identification and quantification of >4,000 proteins in mammalian cell lysates.},

abstract = {Gene annotation underpins genome science. Most often protein coding sequence is inferred from the genome based on transcript evidence and computational predictions. While generally correct, gene models suffer from errors in reading frame, exon border definition, and exon identification. To ascertain the error rate of Arabidopsis thaliana gene models, we isolated proteins from a sample of Arabidopsis tissues and determined the amino acid sequences of 144,079 distinct peptides by tandem mass spectrometry. The peptides corresponded to 1 or more of 3 different translations of the genome: a 6-frame translation, an exon splice-graph, and the currently annotated proteome. The majority of the peptides (126,055) resided in existing gene models (12,769 confirmed proteins), comprising 40\% of annotated genes. Surprisingly, 18,024 novel peptides were found that do not correspond to annotated genes. Using the gene finding program AUGUSTUS and 5,426 novel peptides that occurred in clusters, we discovered 778 new protein-coding genes and refined the annotation of an additional 695 gene models. The remaining 13,449 novel peptides provide high quality annotation (>99\% correct) for thousands of additional genes. Our observation that 18,024 of 144,079 peptides did not match current gene models suggests that 13\% of the Arabidopsis proteome was incomplete due to approximately equal numbers of missing and incorrect gene models.},

@article{Kohlbacher2007b,
abstract = {MOTIVATION: Experimental techniques in proteomics have seen rapid development over the last few years. Volume and complexity of the data have both been growing at a similar rate. Accordingly, data management and analysis are one of the major challenges in proteomics. Flexible algorithms are required to handle changing experimental setups and to assist in developing and validating new methods. In order to facilitate these studies, it would be desirable to have a flexible 'toolbox' of versatile and user-friendly applications allowing for rapid construction of computational workflows in proteomics. RESULTS: We describe a set of tools for proteomics data analysis-TOPP, The OpenMS Proteomics Pipeline. TOPP provides a set of computational tools which can be easily combined into analysis pipelines even by non-experts and can be used in proteomics workflows. These applications range from useful utilities (file format conversion, peak picking) over wrapper applications for known applications (e.g. Mascot) to completely new algorithmic techniques for data reduction and data analysis. We anticipate that TOPP will greatly facilitate rapid prototyping of proteomics data evaluation pipelines. As such, we describe the basic concepts and the current abilities of TOPP and illustrate these concepts in the context of two example applications: the identification of peptides from a raw dataset through database search and the complex analysis of a standard addition experiment for the absolute quantitation of biomarkers. The latter example demonstrates TOPP's ability to construct flexible analysis pipelines in support of complex experimental setups. AVAILABILITY: The TOPP components are available as open-source software under the lesser GNU public license (LGPL). Source code is available from the project website at www.OpenMS.de},
