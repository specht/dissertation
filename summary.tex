A novel platform for the evaluation of mass spectrometric data has been
established and was subsequently employed for the evaluation of measurements
performed to characterize the chloroplast proteome of \cre, along with
the proteome's response under anaerobiosis.
Using the provided tools and workflows, a total of 996 proteins could be 
localized to the chloroplast, for the first time providing experimental proof 
of chloroplast localization for several fermentative proteins.
Furthermore, a quantitative analysis of the chloroplast proteome under 
anaerobiosis was carried out using qTrace.
As expected, fermentative proteins as well as hydrogenase are induced under
these conditions.
