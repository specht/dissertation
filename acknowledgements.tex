Sebastian, Christian, Till, Phillip, Joe -> Proteomatic

Michael Hippler for giving me the opportunity to explore the field of
mass spectrometry-based proteomics which presented me with a multitude
of possibilities to develop computational methods.

Christian Fufezan who introduced me to Python and showed me that it is possible 
after all to have the cake and eat it, too.

I would also like to thank my wife, Jule, who is always full of splendid ideas
and plans that tend to work out.

My children, Charlotte and Leo, who force me to step back from work on a 
regular basis and acknowledge that what's important is highly subjective.

Why the lucky stiff for introducting me to Ruby.

Furthermore, I would like to thank all the incredibly patient people who 
explained the molecular biology 101 to me again and again, and then again,
and never got tired of answering the stupidest of questions.
