First of all, I would like to thank
Michael Hippler for giving me the opportunity to explore the field of
mass spectrometry-based proteomics which presented me with a multitude
of opportunities to solve problems and develop computational strategies.
It has been an incredibly good experience and I have learned a lot.

I would furthermore like to thank:

\begin{itemize}
\item
Sebastian Kuhlgert who explained biochemistry and photosynthesis to me in a 
way that acknowledged my previous experience in the field which was close to 
nil, and impressed me with his smooth working style at the lab bench
whenever I had the chance to watch,

\item
Mia Terashima who I shared a lot of headaches with during many iterations of 
writing and revising manuscripts which turned out to be much easier to cope
with using leetspeak,

\item
Kerstin Trompelt, Ingrid Janßen and Andreas Busch who took me into the lab for
two weeks and made me carry out what felt like hundreds of tasks on \cre~samples 
before the spectral files were finally written to disk which was when I started
to feel more comfortable again,

\item
Jule Wolf who asked lots of questions and wanted to understand protein groups so 
badly that she plastered an entire wall with {\em post-it note} peptides and then
arranged them into proteins and protein groups, which helped,

\item
Jens Allmer who had the original vision of an easy-to-use proteomics data evaluation 
platform,

\item Christian Fufezan who introduced me to Python and showed me that it is possible 
after all to have the cake and eat it, too,

\item
the people who have spent time on improving and extending Proteomatic:
Sebastian Kuhlgert, Christian Fufezan, Till Bald, Phillip Ihmor and Johannes Barth,

\item
Andreas Schaaf who made me 
capable of telling a washing basin from a fermenter,

\item
Martin Scholz who shares a curious affection for trivia from the last decades of 
the twentieth century with me,

\item
all the incredibly patient people who explained various aspects of the molecular 
biology 101 to me again and again -- and then again:
Bianca Naumann, 
Ricarda Höhner,
Frank Bernard,
Elisabeth Ostendorf,
Bernadeta Kukuczka,
Dimitris Petroutsos,
Irina Tolstygina,
Susan Hawat and
Marita Hermann.

\end{itemize}

Finally, I would like to thank my wife, Jule, who is always full of splendid ideas
and plans that tend to work out.
Last but not least I would like to say thanks to my children, Charlotte and Leo, 
who force me to take a step back from work on a regular basis and acknowledge that 
what's important is highly subjective.
