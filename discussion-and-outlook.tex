\chapter{Discussion and outlook}
% ==============================================================

In the scope of this thesis, three software tools have been designed, 
developed and subsequently applied for the investigation of biological 
questions, including the quantitation program qTrace for the characterization 
of the chloroplast proteome of \cre~and its anaerobic response.
In addition, a re-designed version of the Genomic Peptide Finder was used
to establish an automated proteogenomic genome annotation pipeline.
These two systems have been implemented in the context of the data evaluation
platform Proteomatic.

\section{Decentralized MS/MS data evaluation infrastructure}

In order to facilitate software development and utilization, Proteomatic
was designed and implemented to provide a framework for the software
dealing with specific mass spectrometric questions that is presented in 
this thesis.
From the researcher's perspective, Proteomatic provides a way to create and
execute MS/MS data evaluation pipelines without the need to install each of
the individual software tools manually.
Every researcher with access to a computer is able to run data evaluation
pipelines of virtually arbritrary complexity in an independent fashion.
This independence is facilitated by the fact that the system runs on Windows,
Mac OS X, and Linux.
% ------------------------------------

\paragraph{Scalability and robustness.}

From the primary investigator's point of view, Proteomatic implements a 
decentralized data evaluation system, in which the data evaluation requirements
of every researcher can be typically accomodated for with a single computer,
resulting in optimal scalability of the system because each computer acts 
independently.
Furthermore, a distributed system as provided by Proteomatic results in 
increased robustness towards component failure and the lab-wide throughput
is not greatly diminished by one or two failing computers.
Due to the automatic software downloading and update features, a fully 
functional environment can be quickly restored on a new hardware unit.
% ------------------------------------
Therefore, Proteomatic provides an advantage in terms of system reliability 
over existing alternatives such as the Trans-Proteomics Pipeline (TPP) and 
The OpenMS Proteomics Pipeline (TOPP).
Although these systems provide more comprehensive functionality than Proteomatic
currently does, the setup and preparation of these systems to a point where
they become fully functional from the user's perspective is a time-consuming 
process.
Proteomatic downloads and unpacks software automatically when it is required.
In addition, Proteomatic can be set up in such a way that all processing steps
are automatically tracked by a central server.
In the case that the file tracking server fails and cannot be reached, 
Proteomatic stores all reports which could not be sent locally and attempts
to re-send them the next time a script finishes.

TPP requires the installation of an Apache web server for the purpose
of providing a web browser-based graphical user interface (GUI).
While the GUI is helpful for users, the required Apache web server presents a 
non-negligible security risk because it potentially renders the user's computer 
accessible from the Internet.
It can be expected that most users will be unaware of this issue and therefore
not take care to update the web server software regularly.
This issue is especially precarious on Windows and Mac OS X which do not 
natively provide centralized, automatic software updating.
Finally, because Proteomatic is easy to install, it is also beneficial in 
education, giving students the opportunity to gain hands-on MS/MS data 
evaluation experience.

\paragraph{Rapid deployment of novel functionality.}

The fact that mass spectrometric data acquisition is constantly improving in
terms of quantity and quality has fueled the development of software tools for
various data evaluation-related purposes.
Most of these programs can be easily integrated into Proteomatic.
In addition, the deployment of novel, in-house developed functionality is
greatly facilitated by Proteomatic due to its support for multiple scripting
languages and the central script update mechanism.
When novel functionality is being developed, initial decisions should be made 
carefully.
Although Proteomatic can support virtually any programming language, it should
be noted that the choice of an appropriate language must be made carefully.
For example, choosing a programming language which exclusively runs on Windows,
such as C\# restricts the target audience and compromises further possibilities.
Using Proteomatic, tool developers can concentrate on the actual data 
processing and do not have to spend time on creating graphical user interfaces.
An example regarding the calculation of peptide masses is shown in 
Fig.~\ref{fig:rapid-development}.
This approach enables a data processing method development style to which the
`release early, release often' paradigm can be easily applied to 
\citep{Raymond2001}.
While this approach has the potential disadvantage of erroneous software
being deployed to users, especially in the early stages, the faster progress
achieved through early user feedback can be expected to improve the software
quickly.
Because Proteomatic provides a means to push software updates to users,
this approach is especially feasible.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/example-script-2.jpg}
\caption{
{\bf An example of a Proteomatic script.} 
The script, which is implemented in Ruby in this case, is complemented with
a YAML-formatted description which specifies all parameters as well as input
and output files of the script.
The description is used by the Proteomatic front end to automatically construct 
a graphical user interface. This way, prototypes providing novel functionality
or proof of concepts can be deployed early and often.
}
\label{fig:rapid-development}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{File-based data processing.}

One might criticize the apparent lack of visualization capabilities in 
Proteomatic for experimental data and data evaluation results.
This is, however, a design decision which has been made to avoid {\em feature 
creep}, an effect which may lead to failure of software projects due to
an ever-increasing amount of features being implemented which go far beyond the 
originally intended scope.
Proteomatic implements a strictly file-based data processing pipeline which
means that all processing steps are strictly atomic and the output of one
processing step is passed on as one or several files.
This approach allows for manual inspection and intervention at any stage of
a complex pipeline.
Furthermore, all intermediate and final results can be copied to another 
computer or sent via e-mail.
Various standards are emerging for spectral data (mzML, \cite{Deutsch2008}), 
identification results (mzIdentML\footnote{http://www.psidev.info/index.php?q=node/319}), and quantitation results 
(mzQuantML\footnote{http://www.proteomexchange.org/project-organization/workpackages/wp2-standards-development}).
In addition to these standardized file formats, further established file 
formats such as plain text or comma-separated values are used for intermediate 
results.
For each of the file formats employed, specialized viewers already exist
or are currently in development\footnote{http://code.google.com/p/mzidentml-viewer}.
When the user double-clicks on an output file, Proteomatic delegates the
file handling to the underlying operating system which even has a program 
registered to handle the file type or may make a suggestion.
Therefore, a requirement for handling various file types within Proteomatic
is not evident.

\section{Automated quantitation of metabolically labeled samples}

One of the studies presented in this thesis provides a comprehensive list of 
experimentally deduced chloroplast proteins for \cre~for the first time
(manuscript 2).
The list of 895 chloroplast-localized proteins has been compiled using
a quantitative approach via spectral counting.
The necessary data evaluation and filtering steps have been implemented
as processing steps in Proteomatic.
In manuscript 3, the list of chloroplast proteins has been extended 
to 996 proteins, including chloroplast-encoded proteins and further proteins
which have previously been characterized as localized to the chloroplast.
In addition to experimental localization, the anaerobic response of the 
experimentally deduced chloroplast proteome of the green alga is characterized 
in manuscript 2. 

\paragraph{Anaerobic response of the \cre~chloroplast proteome.}

From 895 proteins, 425 proteins could be quantified in manuscript 2, 
confirming the anaerobic induction of hydrogenase, a protein involved in 
hydrogen production.
Furthermore, induction on the protein level could be confirmed for various 
proteins previously found to be induced on the transcript level,
including proteins involved in the fermentative metabolism 
(see Fig.~\ref{fig:qtrace-mia}).
In addition to many ribosomal proteins with varying levels of induction,
pointing to a re-structuring of the chloroplast metabolism via translational 
regulation, a small set of 23 uncharacterized proteins was found to be induced,
four of which are part of the GreenCut \citep{Grossman2010}, and thus represent 
interesting candidates for further research.
One of these 23 proteins, TEF7, was further investigated using a reverse 
genetics approach in which {\em tef7} knockdown mutant strains were generated
and subsequently subjected to anaerobic conditions, showing that these mutants 
were unable to survive (Mia Terashima, personal communication).
This result indicates that TEF7 appears to play a crucial role in the 
acclimation to anaerobic conditions.

\paragraph{High-throughput quantitation in full scans.}

The framework for high-throughput quantitation of metabolically labeled 
samples, in this case by SILAC, is provided by qTrace.
qTrace is a targeted quantitation program which takes a list of peptides
identified via MS/MS, along with their retention time, as input and then 
reconstructs the corresponding isotope envelopes which are subsequently 
matched to the full scans (see Appendix A for a detailed description).
In comparison to MS/MS-based quantitation, this strategy allows for the
incorporation of a large set of data points during the final peptide ratio
estimation because peptides usually elute for a time span long enough to
show their precursor peaks in several successive full scans.
It is obvious that the assignment of precursor peaks in full scans is highly
ambiguous, given the fact that several distinct peptides can yield the
same {\em m/z} values and therefore, peptide identification is not possible
using intact peptide masses only.
In order to remove spurious precursor peak assignments, several filters are 
employed.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/fig6.jpg}
\caption{
{\bf Quantitation results for SILAC labeled \cre~samples under anaerobiosis.} 
Black dots denote quantitation results which have been confirmed by an
MS/MS identification within a retention time window of one minute, white dots
denote confirmation via a manual AMT approach.
Graph A shows quantitation results for 345 proteins stemming from multiple 
combinations of peptide, band, and charge. An additional set of 80 proteins 
deduced from only one such combination are depicted in graph B.
}
\label{fig:qtrace-mia}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Confidence of peak assignments.}

The inherent ambiguity resulting from assigning precursor peaks in full scans
is compensated with the requirement of MS/MS identification in the same band
within a small retention time window of one minute.
The assumption made by such a {\em MS/MS requirement filter} is that once the
identity of a precursor peak has been established via MS/MS, this information
can be expected to remain true within a short time span.
Furthermore, if protein fractionation via SDS-PAGE has been employed, a filter
which determines for each protein the SDS-PAGE band it has been most abundantly
identified in via MS/MS and subsequently discards all quantitation events
from other bands, allowing for a user-defined tolerance, under the assumption
that peak assignments in atypical bands are potential artifacts.

While these filters allow to increase the confidence of quantitation results
by coupling them to the identification results in both retention time and
molecular weight dimensions, assignments of peptides to intact precursor
peaks remains a challenge.
Therefore, quantitation results stemming from the analysis of full scans
should be regarded to provide induced candidate proteins in a discovery-based
experiment and further validation by employing molecular biology techniques
is advisable.

\paragraph{Metabolic labeling strategies.}

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/qtrace-diagram.jpg}
\caption{
{\bf Quantitation results for \textsuperscript{15}N labeled \cre~samples
    under iron deficiency.} 
    Isolated chloroplast proteins from \cre~cultures grown under 
    iron-deficient (\textsuperscript{14}N) and iron-sufficient
    (\textsuperscript{15}N) conditions were mixed and measured via
    GeLC-MS/MS, using five bands from the gel.
    Using Proteomatic, a set of 2,754 distinct peptides could be identified
    via OMSSA which were subsequently passed to qTrace. 
    After carrying out all filtering steps as described in manuscript 2
    and shifting the quantitation results to the protein level,
    a set of 59 proteins or protein groups could be quantified,
    including many light-harvesting proteins.
    Ratios correspond to \textsuperscript{14}N/\textsuperscript{15}N ratios,
    high values correspond to induction under iron deficiency.
    The data presented in this figure was provided by Ricarda H\"ohner.
}
\label{fig:qtrace-15n}
\end{figure}

qTrace supports a variety of metabolic labeling strategies by allowing the 
user to define a non-natural isotope distribution for every chemical element 
occuring in amino acids (hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur).
In addition, these non-natural isotope distributions can be applied 
to a restricted set of amino acids.
Using the user-specified label definition, qTrace is able to handle a variety
of labeling strategies, including SILAC, \textsuperscript{15}N labeling (see 
Fig. \ref{fig:qtrace-15n}), or \textsuperscript{18}O labeling 
\citep{Miyagi2007}.
\textsuperscript{13}C Arg SILAC labeling typically introduces a mass shift
of 6 Da between two sister peptides if trypsin is used for enzymatic digestion
because at most one arginine residue is typically expected per peptide and
arginine contains 6 carbon atoms.
Quantitation results stemming from \textsuperscript{15}N labeled samples
can be regarded as more confident because the mass shift between sister peptides
depends on the amino acid composition.
This is because the label is introduced into every amino acid, and the number of
nitrogen atoms is varying between different amino acids.

% \paragraph{Induction of unannotated proteins.}
% 
% The large-scale quantitation approach presented in manuscript 2 resulted
% in a handful of proteins of unknown function shown to be induced under
% anaerobiosis.
% The quantitative results for these proteins hint towards a possible role
% in response to the experimental condition.
% Therefore, such proteins present interesting candidates for further research.

\section{Further analysis of the \cre~chloroplast proteome}

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/all-four-charts.jpg}
\caption{
    {\bf Visualization of \cre~chloroplast proteome similarities to
    different taxonomic groups.}
    Axes indicate median relative bit scores within each group (see
    manuscript 3 for a detailed description of the score calculation).
}
\label{fig:mia-review-isolines}
\end{figure}

Manuscript 3 provides an in-depth review of the \cre~chloroplast proteome.
In order to provide a foundation for discussion, a comparative analysis 
of the \cre~chloroplast proteome has been carried out by running BLAST
on the 996 protein set against the NCBI non-redundant database.
In order to guarantee that the best-scoring hit would always be a hit to
\cre, the NCBI non-redundant database was supplemented with the protein
sequences of the \cre~chloroplast proteome.
Relative bit scores for each of the 996 proteins were calculated for each of
the four groups: (1) bacteria, (2) plants and mosses, (3) algae, and (4) green 
algae.
Fig.~\ref{fig:mia-review-isolines} provides a proteome-level overview
of the similarities between the \cre~chloroplast proteome and the 4 taxonomic
groups.
Overall, it can be seen that in regard to the chloroplast proteome, there is
a high similarity between green algae and plants/mosses (C) and the overall
picture does not change dramatically when all algae are considered (D).
Although there is also a substantial overlap in the comparison of bacteria
to green algae (A) and algae (B), there are more outlier proteins which seem 
to be more specific to algae.
In addition, the overall trend in all four panels shows high similarity
from the perspective of the proteome, with most proteins near the diagonal
and only few outliers.
Another figure from manuscript 3 provides a hierarchical view on the
\cre~chloroplast proteome (Fig.~\ref{fig:mia-review-wheel}).
It can be seen that the chloroplast covers a wide range of cellular
functions, with protein functions and photosynthesis accounting for
29\% of all proteins.
Another 25\% of all known chloroplast proteins remains uncharacterized.

\end{figure}

\section{Proteogenomic genome annotation}

Manuscript 4 introduces a new version of the Genomic Peptide Finder and
presents a high-throughput strategy for the statistical validation of
GPF peptides and their subsequent use in a proteogenomic genome annotation
approach using AUGUSTUS.

The new GPF version implements two major features:

\begin{enumerate}
\item {\bf Intron splits may occur within a single coding nucleotide triplet.}
This addition increases search sensitivity by considering a possible intron
split in three locations per nucleotide triplet instead of one.

\item {\bf Splice donor/acceptor site consensus sequences may be specified.} 
This modification increases search specificity because spliced peptides with
unusual splice donor/acceptor sites are omitted from the results.
\end{enumerate}

Most importantly, the search has been greatly accelerated due to the use
of a one-time pre-processing step in which an index of the genomic DNA sequence
to be used is created.
For \cre, this indexing step produces an index file of 2.4 GiB in about 15 
minutes.
This initial cost is later compensated during the search which performs
20 queries per second on average on commodity hardware, using commodity flash 
memory to store the index file for faster random access.

Apart from these technical improvements, a method for the automated validation 
of GPF candidate peptides, employing standard database search programs such as 
OMSSA was established.
This allows for statistically robust identification of GPF-deduced peptides
alongside gene model peptides.
Furthermore, an annotation pipeline was established in which resulting GPF
peptides are passed to AUGUSTUS, which performs an {\em ab initio} gene 
model prediction supplemented by various extrinsic hint sources including
GPF peptides.
It is therefore a major contribution of this thesis that an automated
proteogenomic annotation of the \cre~genome in which MS/MS data generated
for various unrelated purposes can be re-used for the generation of
extrinsic AUGUSTUS hints is available.

Using measurements of 949 bands which have been made in various experiments,
a set of 9,336 statistically significant peptides could be deduced via 
{\em de novo} prediction and subsequent GPF processing.
From this peptide set, 1,318 peptides (14\%) contained an intron split,
324 of which were spliced within a single coding nucleotide triplet,
amounting to 25\% of all spliced peptides.
The na\"ive assumption that the consideration of triplet-spliced peptides
would enhance the overall number of spliced peptides by a factor of three,
which would correspond to a relative triplet-spliced peptide amount of 66\%
is therefore not met.
This is in line with previous results which estimate the relative amount
of triplet splicing to be surprisingly low at around 45\% in plants 
\citep{Tomita1996}.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figures/gpf-omssa.jpg}
\caption{
{\bf Validation of GPF candidate peptides via a target/decoy approach
    using previously established gene models.} 
    Statistical significance of identified GPF candidate peptides is 
    assessed by employing a target/decoy approach with existing gene models 
    which may be incomplete but can be expected to contain a high amount of 
    correct sequences.
    GPF peptides are also added to the candidate peptide pool, and the database
    search program (OMSSA) assigns the best match from the pool to each
    MS/MS spectrum, resulting in comparable E-values in between the two
    peptide sources.
    The final E-value threshold determination is performed under exclusive
    consideration of the gene model target and decoy peptides.
    The determined threshold is then applied to all peptide/spectral matches,
    including those to GPF peptides.
}
\label{fig:gpf-omssa}
\end{figure}

The presented pipeline for the generation of peptide hints for the purpose of
proteogenomic annotation is similar to the exon splice graph approach proposed
by \citeauthor{Tanner2007} in that it uses MS/MS scans as a source of candidate
peptides.
However, the GPF approach is less biased in comparison to the exon splice graph
approach because it does not require exon/intron prediction as a first step.
GPF candidate peptides are solely generated from MS/MS {\em de novo} sequencing
and subsequent mapping of the resulting peptides to the genome, using a 
user-defined maximum intron length and a set of possible splice donor/acceptor 
site consensus sequences.
This means that intron prediction is carried out on a per-peptide basis, and
all peptides are treated independently.
The actual validation of extrinsic hints and splice site detection is
carried out by AUGUSTUS in the final annotation step.
Moreover, the approach is highly flexible because no specialized database
search program is required because candidate peptides are inferred by GPF
and then passed down the evaluation pipeline alongside a protein database
(see Fig.~\ref{fig:gpf-omssa}).

% \paragraph{Improved GPF performace.}

Although a gene model protein database is used to estimate the FDR of peptide 
identifications, the final GPF-deduced peptides which are exported as
peptide hints do not originate from this database, although in the case
of \cre, a large portion of these gene model peptides could be 
independently confirmed via the combination of {\em de novo} sequencing and 
GPF (see manuscript 4).
The high amount of 53\% confirmed gene model peptides points to a improvement 
of sensitivity of the new GPF version.
One might argue that the use of {\em de novo} prediction, followed by
error-tolerant, intron-aware matching to a genomic sequence is prone to
produce large sets of similar peptides.
However, this is not the case.
The 10 peptides which are generated by PEAKS for every MS/MS scan are 
reduced to 3.4 peptides on average after employment of GPF 
(see Fig.~\ref{fig:peaks-gpf-workflow}).
Furthermore, as has been shown in manuscript 4, 97\% of all GPF-deduced 
peptides are incorporated into the final gene models by AUGUSTUS.
Because several other hint sources were available to AUGUSTUS and none of
these sources is trusted unconditionally, these numbers suggest a strong 
specificity of GPF peptides.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figures/peaks-gpf-workflow.jpg}
\caption{
    {\bf Example peptides resulting from PEAKS and GPF analysis.}
    In this example, {\em de novo} prediction via PEAKS yielded
    ten peptide sequences, resulting in 3 DNA-deducible GPF peptides.
    One of the GPF peptides, TADLGGNATTSDFTK, resulted from each of
    the ten {\em de novo} predictions and was subsequently assigned
    to the MS/MS scan by OMSSA.
    It should be noted that none of the {\em de novo} predictions
    provided by PEAKS was able to correctly capture the entire peptide 
    sequence.
}
\label{fig:peaks-gpf-workflow}
\end{figure}


\section{Identification of novel targets}

A combination of qTrace and the Genomic Peptide Finder can produce especially
interesting results.
As shown in manuscript 4, the Genomic Peptide Finder can confirm a substantial
amount of gene model peptides.
In addition, previously unknown peptides may result from the analysis.
This is especially true for organisms which for which genome sequencing and
genome annotation are unavailable or are still in the early stages.
Mass spectrometric data stemming from such organisms can be expected to
yield a high amount of novel peptides.
These peptides can be passed to qTrace along with identified gene model 
peptides, possibly resulting in the identification of induced peptides which
are not part of a gene model.
If there is a peptide A stemming from already existing, possibly preliminary gene
models, and a peptide B which has been identified via GPF only, and both
are shown to be co-regulated via qTrace, it might be that the gene model
containg A must be modified to also include B, if B is in close proximity to A
on the genome (and the direction of the reading frames of A and B is equal).
Quantitative information, mapped to the genome, might also be useful to
support proteogenomic genome annotation because peptide clusters exhibiting 
similar regulation patterns might be part of the same gene.
Furthermore, the confidence of a gene model-independent deduction of a novel 
GPF peptide is increased if the same peptide could also be quantified in full
scans, preferably via \textsuperscript{15}N labeling in which the individual
mass shift introduced by the peptide-dependent number of nitrogen atoms acts
as signature fingerprint for the peptide.
Although this mass shift does not confirm the amino acid sequence of the 
peptide, it represents a strong hint that the number of nitrogen atoms in
the GPF peptide is correct.

\section{Outlook}

Although the presented software systems are fully functional and have been
shown to provide useful results in the various studies, there are many
points which should be addressed in the future to further improve the software.

\subsection{Proteomatic}

\paragraph{Remote execution.}

In comparison to a web browser-based user interface as provided by TPP, the 
GUI provided by Proteomatic can be regarded as highly accessible due to 
the support for {\em drag and drop} operations and an overall look and feel
which matches the underlying operating system.
Also, the decentralized approach implemented by Proteomatic leads to a
higher responsiveness of the system because network communication is not 
involved in the pipeline creation process and there is no central server which
could be overloaded from too many requests.
However, it would be favorable to have the option to send a pipeline to a 
dedicated server which would then execute the pipeline and leave the 
user's computer responsive.
In such a setup, the decentralized data evaluation approach would be 
supplemented with an optional centralized data processing step which can
aid in data evaluation but is not vital for the overall availability of
data evaluation functionality.
Because the scripts back end of Proteomatic is able to automatically resolve 
external software dependencies, this approach seems especially feasible because
the server could mimick the specific environment of the user as defined by
the version number currently installed on the user's computer.

\paragraph{Incorporation of a freely available {\em de novo} sequencing software.}

While protein identification and quantitation is implemented in Proteomatic
using free software, the proteogenomic pipeline approach presented in 
manuscript 4 depends on PEAKS for the generation of {\em de novo} predictions.
GPF does not require completely sequences peptides but also works with
short sequence tags that have defined N- and C-terminal masses.
Existing free alternatives such as Lutefisk \citep{Johnson2002}, PepNovo 
\citep{Frank2005} and CompNovo \citep{Bertsch2009} should be evaluated in
terms of performance.
This can be easily accomplished by replacing the {\em de novo} prediction
step with each software, re-running the entire annotation pipeline and 
determining the amount of resulting GPF peptides that have been successfully
incorporated into the resulting gene models.
Once such a freely available {\em de novo} prediction software has been
incorporated, the proteogenomic genome annotation approach could be 
established in a distributed manner which yields comprehensive peptide hints.

\paragraph{Centrally maintained repository of data files.}

The strategy to collect information about external software and offer the
use of these programs by means of a hierarchical menu of processing steps
could be extended to data files such as genome and protein databases.
By providing a centrally maintained repository containing links to freely
available data files in addition to freely available software, the entire
data evaluation process would be simplified because the user is not
required to search for the appropriate files on the internet.
Like software is downloaded automatically as soon as it is required for the 
first time, data files could be downloaded when they are required and would
then remain on the user's computer until a newer version is published in
the Proteomatic data repository.

\paragraph{Refinement of workflow interaction metaphors.}

Proteomatic currently provides a way to establish complex file-based data 
evaluation workflows which can be expressed by a directed acyclic graph (DAG),
iteratively executing processing steps for which all input requirements are
met and thus eventually resolving the entire pipeline.
Software developers are used to the possibility to create loops in their
workflows which is especially useful if the same task should be repeated
several times on different input files.
In order to provide this mechanism to users, Proteomatic offers an interaction 
metaphor which turns a {\em file list} into a {\em file batch}, denoted by a 
yellow arrow (see Appendix~\ref{appendix-b} for an example).
However, as can be seen in the final processing steps of the proteogenomic
genome annotation pipeline depicted in Appendix~\ref{appendix-b}, 
this mechanism complicates matters when
a set of input files should be used as a batch in one situation, and as a
plain list in another situtation.
Currently, this can only by achieved by turning the file batch into a file
list by inserting two CSV file merging steps.
If these steps would be ommited and the original CSV results file batch
would be provided as input to the {\em Generate AUGUSTUS hints} processing
step, 46 output files with partially redundant entries would emerge from
the pipeline.
A possible solution to this issue would be to define batch behaviour per
arrow instead, thus allowing a set of files to be used as input to one single 
processing step yielding a single output file, but at the same time the
set of files could be used for the repeated execution of another processing
step, yielding one output file for every specified input file.

\paragraph{Filetracker querying.}

While the collection of comprehensive reports for all executed processing steps
is implemented and more than 15,000 reports have already been recorded, a
user-friendly mechanism for querying this data repository does not yet exist.
In order to enable the accurate reconstruction of finished data processing 
workflows, a program is required which provides access to the reports collected
by a Proteomatic file tracking server.
This could be accomplished in a similar way that access to a MP3 music library 
is provided where the entire set of songs can be reduced by selecting a subset 
of artists or albums. 
In the same manner, the set of available processing steps could be controlled
by specifying details such as the user name or the approximate time the data
evaluation was carried out.
In addition, the MD5 checksum of generated output files could be used to 
determine the processing step which yielded the file.
Starting from a particular processing step, the entire data processing graph
can be traversed in both upstream and downstream directions, and all related
processing steps involved in the genesis of the final output file can
be seamlessly reconstructed.

% {\bf Unfinished prototype of a file tracker querying tool.}

% \label{fig:revelio}
% \end{figure}

\subsection{qTrace}

\paragraph{Performance comparison to existing alternatives.}

While qTrace has been employed successfully for the data analysis in 
manuscript 2 and continues to provide interesting results in subsequent 
experiments, a comprehensive performance assessment and comparison to existing 
alternatives has not been carried out.
Several free programs for SILAC \citep{Kohlbacher2007, Cox2008, Mortensen2010} 
and \textsuperscript{18}O quantitation \citep{Halligan2005, Shinkawa2005} exist.
Although many of these tools are restricted in some way, e. g. running on
Windows only or working exclusively in conjunction with the commercial MASCOT
software, the underlying models in each implementation can be expected to
have a substantial impact on the quantity and quality of quantitation results.

\paragraph{AMT-based validation and untargeted quantitation.}

The validation of precursor peak assignments is currently performed using
peptide identifications in MS/MS spectra which have been recorded at 
approximately the same time as the full scan.
Because there is an upper limit to the number of peptides identified via MS/MS
scans and many more intact peptides are typically contained in a full scan,
this approach also limits the number of quantified peptides.
An AMT-based validation approach \citep{Mueller2007} resolves this issue by
also considering peptide identification which have been made in other 
measurements by aligning retention times between individual runs and 
resolving the identity of precursor peaks in one run via identified MS/MS scans
from another run.
Because of the modular setup provided by Proteomatic, such an approach can
be easily implemented without modifying the qTrace source code.
In order to perform AMT-based validation, the {\em MS/MS requirement filter}
would simply be replaced by a novel filter step which validates precursor
peak assignments based on a AMT database.

Another perspective for the further development of qTrace is to implement
untargeted peptide quantitation. 
In such an approach, no input peptides would be specified and the algorithm
would try to recognize sister peptides by their mass shift.
The untargeted quantitation approach would be especially useful in conjunction
with AMT-based validation of quantitation events because potentially more 
peptides could be quantified.

\subsection{Genomic Peptide Finder}

\paragraph{Increased search sensitivity.}

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) account for up to 80\% of interindivual
genomic differences and are regarded to be useful for the assessment of disease
susceptibility and also treatment.
SNPs thus play an important role on the road towards personalized medicine 
\citep{Carlson2008}.
It would be a useful extension to the current implementation of GPF to provide 
a mechanism which allows for the consideration of possible SNPs in the genome.
Because SNPs occur rarely, it can be assumed that the consideration of a single
SNP per peptide is sufficient.
Because the consideration of a single SNP in a genomic sequence of $n$ base pairs
can give rise to at most $3 \cdot n$ alternatives (which do not necessarily
result in a different amino acid sequence), the time complexity of this algorithm
is linear and thus the resulting increase in search time should be justifiable.
